## What is a sensory system

::: columns
::: column
A sensory system allows the nervous system to `detect` and process `stimuli` from the environment.

>Each system is specialized for a particular form of energy or stimulus.

Despite their differences, sensory systems share common organizational principles.

[Sensory Transduction]{.highlight}

Sensory systems work by converting `physical stimuli` into `neural signals`.
This process is called **`transduction`**.

>[Sensory receptors]{.highlight}: Sensory transduction begins at **[sensory receptors]{.highlight}**.

:::info-box

Different receptors are tuned to different stimulus types:

- `Photoreceptors` detect light  
- `Mechanoreceptors` detect touch and vibration  
- `Chemoreceptors` detect chemicals  
- `Nociceptors` detect damaging stimuli
