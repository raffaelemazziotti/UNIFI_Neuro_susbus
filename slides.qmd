## Module Overview

Module 1

1. [The Neuron](#neuron)
2. [Ion Movement](#ion-movement)

## What Is Neuroscience? {#neuron}

::: columns
::: column
Neuroscience asks a simple question:  
**How does the brain produce behavior?**

- Studies the Central (brain and spinal cord) and Peripheral (somatic, autonomic and enteric) nervous systems  
- Connects biology, psychology, physics, engineering, and philosophy 

**Goal of this course:** build intuition about how the nervous system works, without assuming prior biology knowledge.

## What Is a Neuron?

::: columns
::: column
Neurons are the **basic units** of the brain.  
Their main function is to **send electrical signals** over short and long distances.  
They are electrically and chemically excitable.
The function of a neuron depends on its structure.

## Major Parts of the Neuron

::: columns

::: column
- **Dendrites**  
- **Cell body (soma)**
- **Axon hillock**
- **Axon**
- **Presynaptic terminal**
These components determine how signals are received, processed, and transmitted.
:::

::: column

## Diagram: Typical Neuron

::: columns
::: column
A neuron has:  
- Branching dendrites  
- A soma with nucleus  
- A long axon  
- Terminal branches forming synapses
:::

::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
::: 

---

## Dendrites {#dendrites}

::: columns
::: column
- Branch out from the soma  
- Primary targets of incoming signals  
- The number of dendrites influences how many inputs the neuron can receive  
- Often contain **spines**, which increase surface area for synaptic contact
::: 
::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
::: 
---

## Cell Body (Soma) {#soma}

::: columns
::: column
- Contains nucleus and organelles  
- Integrates incoming signals from dendrites  
- Biochemistry of the cell shapes its excitability and response properties  
::: 

::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
:::

---

## Axon Hillock {#hillock}
::: columns
::: column
- Junction between soma and axon  
- Location where **action potentials are initiated**  
- Sensitive to the summed electrical inputs from dendrites and soma
::: 

::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
:::
---

## The Axon
::: columns
::: column
- Conducts electrical signals over long distances  
- May be myelinated to increase conduction speed  
- Can branch extensively
::: 

::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
:::
---

## Presynaptic Terminal
::: columns
::: column
- End of the axon  
- Releases neurotransmitter onto postsynaptic cells  
- Forms multiple terminals for communication with many neurons
::: 

::: column
![](images/neuron_compartments.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
::: 
:::
---

## Neurons Communicate Electrically and Chemically

1. **Electrical signals** travel along the axon.  
2. **Chemical signals** (neurotransmitters) are released at the synapse.  

This dual mode of signaling enables fast and flexible communication.

---

## Structure Influences Function
::: columns
::: column
Examples:
- More dendrites → more inputs  
- Axon myelination → faster conduction  
- Terminal branching → more downstream targets  

Form and function are tightly linked in neuronal physiology.

## Neuron Diversity (Overview)

Neurons vary in:

- Size  
- Shape  
- Dendritic complexity  
- Axon length  
- Neurotransmitter type  

This diversity supports specialized functions across the nervous system.

---

## Summary of Key Concepts

- Neurons are the fundamental signaling units of the nervous system  
- Structure determines function  
- Signals are electrical within neurons and chemical between them  
- Dendrites receive, soma integrates, axon transmits, terminals communicate  

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. Which part of the neuron initiates the action potential?  
2. How do dendritic spines enhance synaptic communication?  
3. Why does neuron structure influence neuron function?  
4. Which part releases neurotransmitter?

---

## Ion Movement{#ion-movement}
::: columns
::: column
Neurons communicate using electrical signals.  
These signals exist because [ions move across cell membranes]{.highlight}.

Understanding ion movement is the foundation for:

- Electrical signaling
- Membrane potential
- Action potentials
- Synaptic transmission
:::
::: column
![](images/ion_einstein.gif){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## What Is an Ion?{#ions}
::: columns
::: column
An **ion** is an atom or molecule with an [electrical charge]{.highlight}.

- Positive charge → cation  
- Negative charge → anion  

In neuroscience, the most important ions are:

- Sodium (Na⁺)
- Potassium (K⁺)
- Chloride (Cl⁻)
- Calcium (Ca²⁺)
:::
::: column
![](images/ions.png){width="300" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## Why Charges Matter in the Brain

Electrical signals arise because:

- Ions carry charge
- Neurons separate charges across membranes
- Differences in charge create electrical forces

No electricity, no neural signaling.

---

## The Neuronal Membrane

::: columns
::: column
The neuron is surrounded by a [lipid bilayer membrane]{.highlight}.

Key properties:

- Electrically insulating
- Impermeable to most ions
- Contains specialized proteins that allow controlled ion movement

This separation is essential for signaling.
:::
::: column
![](images/bilayer.png){width="450" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## Ion Channels
::: columns
::: column
Ion channels are [proteins embedded in the membrane]{.highlight}.

They:

- Allow specific ions to cross
- Are selective (not all ions can pass)
- Can open or close

Ion movement only occurs through these channels.
:::
::: column
![](images/bilayer_protein.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## Channel Selectivity

::: columns
::: column
Ion channels are selective because:

- Ions differ in size
- Ions differ in charge
- Channel pores are highly specific

Example:

- Sodium channels allow Na⁺ but not K⁺
- Potassium channels allow K⁺ but not Na⁺
:::
::: column
![](images/ion_ch_selective.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## Two Forces Acting on Ions

Ion movement depends on **two forces**:

1. **Diffusion**  
2. **Electrical attraction or repulsion**

The combined effect determines ion flow.

---

## Diffusion

::: columns
::: column

Diffusion is movement from:


```{mermaid}

  B[Low concentration]

  B -. No net flow .-> A

  style B fill:#2b2b2b,stroke:#67bdfb,color:#e6e6e6
  linkStyle default stroke:#bbbbbb,stroke-width:2px
  ```
If more [Na⁺](#ions) ions are outside the neuron than inside, [Na⁺](#ions) tends to move inward.

::: info-box
It does `not` require energy.
:::

:::
::: column
![](images/diffusion.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## Electrical Forces

::: columns
::: column
Charged particles are influenced by:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Opposite charges attract
- Same charges repel
:::
A negatively charged interior attracts positive ions.
:::
::: column
![](images/ions_electric_force.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## Electrochemical Gradient

The **electrochemical gradient** combines:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Chemical gradient (diffusion)
- Electrical gradient (charge)
:::
Ion movement depends on `both` at the same time.

This is the key principle of neural signaling.

---

## Example: Sodium Ions (Na⁺)

Typically:

::: {.nonincremental}
- High Na⁺ outside the neuron
- Low Na⁺ inside
- Inside of neuron is negatively charged
:::
Both diffusion and electrical forces push Na⁺ **into** the cell.

::: info-box
The inside of the neuron (and cells in general) is negative mainly because of large amount of `anions` inside the cell like `proteins` and other large organic anions (phosphates, metabolites).
:::

---

## Example: Potassium Ions (K⁺)

Typically:

::: {.nonincremental}
- High K⁺ inside the neuron
- Low K⁺ outside
- Electrical force pulls K⁺ inward
- Diffusion pushes K⁺ outward
:::
The two forces oppose each other.

---

## Equilibrium Potential

The **equilibrium potential** is the membrane voltage at which:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Electrical force exactly balances diffusion
- No net movement of an ion occurs
:::

Each ion has its own equilibrium potential.

---

## Important Concept

Different ions want to move in different directions.

Neural electrical signals emerge from:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Which channels are open
- Which ions can move
- The direction of ion flow
:::

---

## Calcium Ions (Ca²⁺){#calcium}

Calcium is special because:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Very low concentration inside neurons
- Strong electrical charge
- Acts as both an ion and a signaling molecule
:::

Opening Ca²⁺ channels has powerful effects.

---

## Ion Movement Is Passive

Ion movement through channels:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Does not require energy
- Is driven by electrochemical gradients
:::

>`But maintaining the gradients require energy!` The gradients are maintained by specific proteins called **pumps** that can move ions against their gradients.

---

## Membrane Voltage

::: columns
::: column
The neuron’s membrane separates electrical charges.

This separation creates a quantity called **membrane voltage**.

- Voltage is a *difference* in electrical potential
- It tells us how strong the electrical force is
- It is measured across the membrane, not inside the cell

::: info-box
Voltage is not a substance and not a force.  
It is a measure of how much electrical energy is available to move charges.
:::
:::
::: column
![](images/membrane_voltage.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## Equilibrium Potential (Formal Definition)

The **equilibrium potential** of an ion is:

>The membrane voltage at which there is `no net movement` of that ion across the membrane.

Important points:

- It depends on concentration differences
- It depends on charge

---

## The Nernst Equation

To describe equilibrium **quantitatively**, we use the **Nernst equation**.

It links:

- ion concentration differences
- electrical voltage across the membrane

$$
E_{\mathrm{ion}} = \frac{RT}{zF}\ln\left(\frac{[\mathrm{ion}]_{\mathrm{out}}}{[\mathrm{ion}]_{\mathrm{in}}}\right)
$$

::: {.nonincremental}
- $E_{\mathrm{ion}}$: equilibrium potential of the ion  
- $R$: gas constant  
- $T$: absolute temperature  
- $z$: ion charge (valence)  
- $F$: Faraday constant  
:::

---

## What the Equation Means (Not How to Use It)

You do not need to memorize this formula.

What matters is what it tells us:

- Larger concentration differences → larger equilibrium voltage
- Higher charge → stronger electrical effect
- Each ion has its own equilibrium potential

::: info-box
The term \(z\) is the ion’s charge:

| Ion | z  | Inside Concentration  |   Outside Concentation   |  Equilibrium Potential  |
|-----|----|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| K⁺  | +1 |         15 mM         |          145 mM          |         + 60 mV         |
| Na⁺ | +1 |        125 mM         |           5 mM           |         -85 mV          |
| Ca²⁺| +2 |       0.0002 mM       |           2 mM           |         125 mV          |
| Cl⁻ | -1 |         13 mM         |          150 mM          |         -65 mV          |
:::

---

## From Equilibrium Potential to Membrane Potential

So far we have described equilibrium for **one ion at a time**.

Real neurons are a bit different:

- Multiple ion species are present
- Multiple channels are open simultaneously

The membrane voltage reflects the `combined effect` of all ions.

---

## What Is the Membrane Potential?

> The **membrane potential** is: The electrical potential difference between the inside and the outside of the cell membrane. It is measured in [millivolts (mV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt), 1 mV = 0.001 Volts (V).

Each ion has:

- Its own equilibrium potential
- Its own concentration gradient

But the membrane potential is:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Not equal to $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$
- Not equal to $E_{\mathrm{K}}$
- Not equal to $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$
- It lies `between` them.
:::

---

## Which Ion Dominates?

The influence of an ion depends on: 

> `Permeability`, a measure of how easily a given ion can cross the membrane through its channels.

At rest, neuronal membranes are:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Highly permeable to $K^+$
- Weakly permeable to $Na^+$
- Moderately permeable to $Cl^-$
:::

As a result, the membrane potential is close to $E_{\mathrm{K}}$.

::: info-box
In most neurons `resting membrane potential` is $\approx -65\,\mathrm{mV}$.
This reflects potassium dominance at rest.
:::

---

## Voltage Change

If channels open for an ion the membrane potential moves toward that ion’s equilibrium potential.

::: columns
::: column
::: info-box
**Example: Opening Sodium Channels**

If $Na^+$ channels open:

- $Na^+$ enters the cell
- Membrane potential becomes less negative
- Voltage moves toward $E_{\mathrm{Na}} \approx +60\,\mathrm{mV}$

This process is called `depolarization`.
:::
:::
::: column
::: info-box
**Example: Opening Potassium Channels**

If $K^+$ channels open:

- $K^+$ leaves the cell
- Membrane potential becomes more negative
- Voltage moves toward $E_{\mathrm{K}} \approx -90\,\mathrm{mV}$

This process is called `hyperpolarization`.
:::
:::
:::

---

## The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz Equation

When multiple ions contribute to the membrane voltage, the membrane potential is given by the **Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) equation**:

$$
V_m =
\frac{RT}{F}
\ln\!\left(
\frac{
P_{\mathrm{K}}[K^+]_{\mathrm{out}} +
P_{\mathrm{Na}}[Na^+]_{\mathrm{out}} +
P_{\mathrm{Cl}}[Cl^-]_{\mathrm{in}}
}{
P_{\mathrm{K}}[K^+]_{\mathrm{in}} +
P_{\mathrm{Na}}[Na^+]_{\mathrm{in}} +
P_{\mathrm{Cl}}[Cl^-]_{\mathrm{out}}
}
\right)
$$

::: columns
::: column
::: {.nonincremental}
- $V_m$ is the membrane potential  
- $P_{\mathrm{K}}, P_{\mathrm{Na}}, P_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ are permeabilities  
- $[\cdot]_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $[\cdot]_{\mathrm{out}}$ are ion concentrations  
- $R$, $T$, and $F$ have the same meaning as in the Nernst equation  
:::

>If only one ion is permeable: Goldman reduces to Nernst

:::

::: column
::: info-box
You may notice that:

- $[Cl^-]_{\mathrm{in}}$ appears in the numerator
- $[Cl^-]_{\mathrm{out}}$ appears in the denominator

This happens because:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Chloride carries a negative charge
- Its electrical force acts in the opposite direction
:::

:::
:::
:::

---

## From Steady Voltage to Signals

Neurons use changes in membrane potential as signals.

These changes can be:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Small or large
- Slow or fast
- Local or long-range
:::

::: info-box
Two main types exist:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Graded potentials**
- **Action potentials**
:::

They differ in origin, size, and function.

:::

---

## Graded Potentials


> [Graded potential]{.highlight}: **local change** in membrane potential whose magnitude depends on the strength of the stimulus.

:::columns
:::column
Key properties:

- Amplitude varies continuously
- Can be `depolarizing` or `hyperpolarizing`
- Spread passively
- Become smaller with distance
:::

::: column
::: info-box
This decay is due to:

- Membrane resistance
- Cytoplasmic resistance
:::


::: info-box
They are common in:

- [Dendrites](#dendrites)
- [Soma](#soma)
:::

:::
:::

---

## Integration of Graded Potentials

::: columns

::: column

Multiple graded potentials can:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Add together in space (spatial summation)
- Add together in time (temporal summation)
:::

>Neurons continuously integrate incoming signals.

Integration mainly occurs at:

::: {.nonincremental}
- The cell body
- The axon initial segment ([axon hillock](#hillock))
:::

>This region decides whether a [new type]{.highlight} of signal is generated.

:::

::: column

![](images/neuron_gp_summation.jpg){width="400" fig-align="right"}

:::

:::

---

## Action Potentials {#actionpotential}
::: columns
::: column
If depolarization is strong enough:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A critical voltage is reached
- A different electrical event is triggered
:::

This voltage is called the [threshold]{.highlight}. Potentials beyond the threshold trigger `Action Potentials`.


>**Action potential**: A large, rapid, and `stereotyped` change in membrane potential, originated at the level of the axon [hillock](#hillock), that propagates along the axon.
::: 
::: column
![](images/neuron_signals.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## Why Action Potentials Are Needed
::: columns
::: column
Graded potentials decay with distance.

To communicate over long axons, neurons need:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A signal that does not fade
- A reliable, all-or-none event
:::

That signal is the action potential.

:::info-box
To understand action potentials, we must explain:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Voltage-gated ion channels
- Positive feedback
- Time-dependent permeability changes
:::
:::

:::
::: column
![](images/neuron_action_pot_crop.gif){width="400" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Membrane Proteins and Transport

The lipid bilayer is electrically insulating. Ions can cross the membrane only through **membrane proteins**.

Membrane transport proteins fall into two broad categories:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Channels**
- **Transporters (carriers and pumps)**
:::

::: info-box
[Ion channel]{.highlight}: A protein that forms a continuous aqueous pathway across the membrane, allowing ions to move down their electrochemical gradient.

Properties:

- Do not use metabolic energy (passive)
- Do not move ions against gradients (no energy)
- Selective to specific Ions

:::

---

## Channel Gating

Ion channels are not static holes.

They fluctuate between:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Closed states
- Open states
:::

>[Gating]{.highlight}: The process by which an ion channel switches between open and closed states.

::: info-box
Channels can be gated by different physical signals:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Chemical binding (ligand-gated - e.g. Neurotransmitters)
- Mechanical deformation (mechanosensitive)
- Membrane voltage (voltage-gated - activated when the membrane cross a specific voltage)
:::
:::

---

## Graded Potentials and Channels

During Graded Potentials:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Passive channels remain unchanged
- Voltage-gated channels remain mostly closed
:::

>Voltage changes are **passive and proportional** to input and decay over space-time.

When depolarization is small:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A few voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open
- Resulting $Na^+$ influx is weak
- Leak and $K^+$ currents counteract depolarization
:::

The voltage relaxes back to rest.

---

## Threshold Crossing

At threshold:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channel opening becomes significant
- $Na^+$ influx exceeds opposing currents
- Depolarization accelerates
:::

This marks the transition from **passive to active** behavior.

::: info-box
Once threshold is crossed:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Many $Na^+$ channels open rapidly
- Membrane permeability to $Na^+$ increases sharply
- Voltage changes are no longer passive
:::

The action potential is initiated.
:::

---

## During the Action Potential

During the spike:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open, then inactivate
- Voltage-gated $K^+$ channels open with delay
- Passive channels are negligible by comparison
:::

Voltage is dominated by **voltage-gated dynamics**.

After the action potential:

::: {.nonincremental}
- $Na^+$ channels recover from inactivation
- $K^+$ channels close
- Passive channels dominate again
:::


>[Inactivation]{.highlight}: A state in which a voltage-gated channel is closed and temporarily unable to reopen, even though the membrane is still depolarized.
