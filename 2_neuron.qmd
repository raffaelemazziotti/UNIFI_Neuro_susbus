## 2. Ion Movement{#ion-movement}
::: columns
::: column
Neurons communicate using electrical signals.  
These signals exist because [ions move across cell membranes]{.highlight}.

Understanding ion movement is the foundation for:

- Electrical signaling
- Membrane potential
- Action potentials
- Synaptic transmission
:::
::: column
![](images/ion_einstein.gif){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## 2. What Is an Ion?{#ions}
::: columns
::: column
An **ion** is an atom or molecule with an [electrical charge]{.highlight}.

- Positive charge → cation  
- Negative charge → anion  

In neuroscience, the most important ions are:

- Sodium (Na⁺)
- Potassium (K⁺)
- Chloride (Cl⁻)
- Calcium (Ca²⁺)
:::
::: column
![](images/ions.png){width="300" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## 2. Why Charges Matter in the Brain

Electrical signals arise because:

- Ions carry charge
- Neurons separate charges across membranes
- Differences in charge create electrical forces

> No electricity → no neural signaling.

---

## 2. The Neuronal Membrane

::: columns
::: column
The neuron is surrounded by a [lipid bilayer membrane]{.highlight}.

Key properties:

- Electrically insulating
- Impermeable to most ions

This separation is essential for signaling.
:::
::: column
![](images/bilayer.png){width="450" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## 2. Ion Channels
::: columns
::: column
Ion channels are [proteins embedded in the membrane]{.highlight}.

They:

- Allow specific ions to cross
- Are [selective]{.highlight} (not all ions can pass)
- Can open or close

> Ion movement only occurs through these channels.

:::
::: column
![](images/bilayer_protein.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## 2. Channel Selectivity

::: columns
::: column
Ion channels are selective because:

- Ions differ in size
- Ions differ in charge
- Channel pores are highly specific

Example:

- Sodium channels allow Na⁺ but not K⁺
- Potassium channels allow K⁺ but not Na⁺
:::
::: column
![](images/ion_ch_selective.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## 2. Two Forces Acting on Ions

Ion movement depends on **two forces**:

1. **Diffusion**  
2. **Electrical attraction or repulsion**

> The combined effect determines [ion flow]{.highlight}.

---

## 2. Diffusion

::: columns
::: column

Diffusion is movement from:


```{mermaid}

  B -. No net flow .-> A

  ```
If more [Na⁺](#ions) ions are outside the neuron than inside, [Na⁺](#ions) tends to move inward.

::: info-box
It does `not` require energy.
:::

:::
::: column
![](images/diffusion.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## 2. Electrical Forces

::: columns
::: column
Charged particles are influenced by:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Opposite charges attract
- Same charges repel
:::
A negatively charged interior attracts positive ions.
:::
::: column
![](images/ions_electric_force.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::
---

## 2. Electrochemical Gradient

The **electrochemical gradient** combines:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Chemical gradient (diffusion)
- Electrical gradient (charge)
:::
Ion movement depends on `both` at the same time.

This is the key principle of neural signaling.

---

## 2. Example: Sodium Ions (Na⁺)

Typically:

::: {.nonincremental}
- High Na⁺ outside the neuron
- Low Na⁺ inside
- Inside of neuron is negatively charged
:::

> Both diffusion and electrical forces push Na⁺ **inward**.

::: info-box
The inside of the neuron (and cells in general) is negative mainly because of large amount of `anions` inside the cell like `proteins` and other large organic anions (phosphates, metabolites).
:::

---

## 2. Example: Potassium Ions (K⁺)


::: {.nonincremental}
- High K⁺ inside the neuron
- Low K⁺ outside
- Electrical force pulls K⁺ inward
- Diffusion pushes K⁺ outward
:::

> Here the diffusion force in higher that the electical force an K⁺ flux tends to go **outward**

---

## 2. Example: Calcium Ions (Ca²⁺){#calcium}

::: {.nonincremental}
- Very low concentration inside neurons
- Strong positive electrical charge
- [Acts as both an ion and a signaling molecule]{.highlight}
:::

> Opening Ca²⁺ channels causes a inward flux of Ca²⁺ ions.

---

## 2. Ion Movement Is Passive

Ion movement through channels:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Does not require energy
- Is driven by electrochemical gradients
:::

>`But maintaining the gradients require energy!` The gradients are maintained by specific proteins called **pumps** that can move ions against their gradients.

---

## 2. Membrane Voltage

::: columns
::: column
The neuron’s membrane separates electrical charges.

This separation creates a quantity called **membrane voltage**.

- Voltage is a *difference* in electrical potential
- It tells us how strong the electrical force is
- It is measured across the membrane, not inside the cell

::: info-box
Voltage is not a substance and not a force.  
It is a measure of how much electrical energy is available to move ions.

:::
:::
::: column
![](images/membrane_voltage.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## 2. Which Ion Dominates?

The influence of an ion depends on: 

> `Permeability`, a measure of how easily a given ion can cross the membrane through its channels and is given by the number of ions for that channel are open.

At rest, neuronal membranes are:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Highly permeable to $K^+$
- Weakly permeable to $Na^+$
- Moderately permeable to $Cl^-$
:::

::: info-box
In most neurons `resting membrane potential` is $\approx -65\,\mathrm{mV}$.
This reflects potassium dominance at rest.
:::

---

## 2. Voltage Change {#voltage_change}

If channels open for an ion, the membrane potential changes. If a positive ion moves inside the cell, the membrane potential becomes less negative; if it moves outside, it becomes more negative. For negative ions, the effect is reversed.

::: columns
::: column
::: info-box
**Example: Opening Sodium Channels**

If $Na^+$ channels open:

- $Na^+$ enters the cell
- Membrane potential becomes less negative

This process is called `depolarization`.
:::
:::
::: column
::: info-box
**Example: Opening Potassium Channels**

If $K^+$ channels open:

- $K^+$ leaves the cell
- Membrane potential becomes more negative

This process is called `hyperpolarization`.

:::
:::
:::

---

## 2. From Steady Voltage to Signals

Neurons use changes in membrane potential as `signals`.

These changes can be:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Small or large (millivolts )
- Slow or fast (milliseconds)
- Local or long-range (micrometers to meters)
:::

::: info-box
Two main types exist:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Graded potentials**
- **Action potentials**
:::

They differ in origin, size, and function.

:::

---

## 2. Graded Potentials {#graded_potential}


> [Graded potential]{.highlight}: **local change** in membrane potential whose magnitude depends on the strength of the stimulus.

:::columns
:::column
Key properties:

- Amplitude varies continuously
- Can be `depolarizing` or `hyperpolarizing`
- Spread passively
- Become smaller with distance
:::

::: column
::: info-box
This decay is due to:

- Membrane resistance
- Cytoplasmic resistance
:::


::: info-box
They are common in:

- [Dendrites](1_intro.html#dendrites)
- [Soma](1_intro.html#soma)
:::

:::
:::

---

## 2. Integration of Graded Potentials

::: columns

::: column

Multiple graded potentials can:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Add together in space ([spatial summation]{.highlight})
- Add together in time ([temporal summation]{.highlight})
:::

Integration mainly occurs at:

::: {.nonincremental}
- The cell body
- The axon initial segment ([axon hillock](0_intro.html#hillock))
:::

>Neurons continuously integrate incoming signals.

:::

::: column

![](images/neuron_gp_summation.jpg){width="400" fig-align="right"}

:::

:::

---

## 2. Action Potentials {#actionpotential}
::: columns
::: column
If depolarization is strong enough:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A critical voltage is reached
- A different electrical event is triggered
:::

This voltage is called the [threshold]{.highlight}. Potentials beyond the threshold trigger `Action Potentials`.


>**Action potential**: A large, rapid, and `stereotyped` change in membrane potential, originated at the level of the [axon hillock](1_intro.html#hillock), that propagates along the axon.
::: 
::: column
![](images/neuron_signals.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## 2. Why Action Potentials Are Needed
::: columns
::: column
> Graded potentials decay with distance.

To communicate over long axons, neurons need:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A signal that does not fade
- A reliable, all-or-none event
:::

![](images/neuron_bursting.png){width="400" fig-align="right"}

:::
::: column
![](images/neuron_action_pot_crop.gif){width="400" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::


---

## 2. Membrane Proteins and Transport

The lipid bilayer is electrically insulating. Ions can cross the membrane only through **membrane proteins**.

Membrane transport proteins fall into two broad categories:

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Channels**
- **Transporters (carriers and pumps)**
:::

::: info-box
[Ion channel]{.highlight}: A protein that forms a continuous aqueous pathway across the membrane, allowing ions to move down their electrochemical gradient.

Properties:

- Do not use metabolic energy (passive)
- Do not move ions against gradients (no energy)
- Selective to specific Ions

:::

---

## 2. Channel Gating

::: columns
::: column

Ion channels are not static holes.

They fluctuate between:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Closed states
- Open states
:::

::: info-box
Channels can be `gated` by different physical signals:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Chemical binding (ligand-gated - e.g. Neurotransmitters)
- Mechanical deformation (mechanosensitive)
- Membrane voltage (voltage-gated - activated when the membrane cross a specific voltage)
:::

:::

:::
::: column
>[Gating]{.highlight}: The process by which an ion channel switches between open and closed states.

![](images/ion_channel.gif){width="500" fig-align="right"}

:::
:::

---

## 2. Graded Potentials and Channels

During Graded Potentials:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Passive channels remain unchanged
- Voltage-gated channels remain mostly closed
:::

>Voltage changes are **passive and proportional** to input and decay over space-time.

When depolarization is small:

::: {.nonincremental}
- A few voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open
- Resulting $Na^+$ influx is weak
- Passive $K^+$ currents counteract depolarization
:::

The voltage relaxes back to rest.

---

## 2. Threshold Crossing

At threshold:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channel opening becomes significant
- $Na^+$ influx exceeds opposing currents
- Depolarization accelerates
:::

This marks the transition from **passive to active** behavior.

::: info-box
Once threshold is crossed:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Many $Na^+$ channels open rapidly
- Membrane permeability to $Na^+$ increases sharply
- Voltage changes are no longer passive
:::

The action potential is initiated.
:::

---

## 2. During the Action Potential

::: columns
::: column
During the spike:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open, then `inactivate`
- Voltage-gated $K^+$ channels open with delay
:::

Voltage is dominated by **voltage-gated dynamics**.

After the action potential:

::: {.nonincremental}
- $Na^+$ channels recover from inactivation
- $K^+$ channels close
- Passive channels dominate again
:::
:::
::: column
![](images/neuron_action_potential.gif){width="400" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

>[Inactivation]{.highlight}: A state in which a voltage-gated channel is closed and temporarily unable to reopen, even though the membrane is still depolarized.

---

## 2. Refractory Period

::: columns
::: column
After an action potential, the neuron cannot immediately fire another spike.

>**Refractory period**: A time interval following an action potential during which the neuron’s ability to generate another action potential is `reduced or absent`.

This phase is caused purely by **Na⁺ channel inactivation**.

Refractory periods ensure that:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Action potentials propagate in one direction
- Spikes are separated in time (`neural code`)
- Maximum firing frequency is limited
:::

:::
::: column
![](images/neuron_action_potential.gif){width="400" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

---

## 2. Axon Diameter and Conduction Speed

The speed of action potential propagation depends on axon geometry.

Larger axons:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Have lower internal (axial) resistance
- Allow local currents to spread more easily
- Depolarize adjacent membrane faster
:::

As a result, action potentials propagate **faster** in thicker axons.

---

## 2. Myelination

::: columns
::: column

Many axons, especially long ones, are wrapped in myelin, a multilayered insulating sheath formed by `glial` cells. This ensures that the signal reaches its destination.

Myelination is not continuous along the axon. Axons contain regularly spaced gaps called **nodes of Ranvier**.

::: info-box
At nodes:

- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ and $K^+$ channels are highly concentrated
- Action potentials are `regenerated`
- Saltatory conduction (the action potential jumps from one node to the other)
:::

:::
::: column

![](images/neuron_saltatory.gif){width="400" fig-align="right"}
