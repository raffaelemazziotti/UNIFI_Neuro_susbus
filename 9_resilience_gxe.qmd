## What is Resilience

::: columns
::: column

The term `resilience` originally comes from metallurgy.

>It refers to the ability of a material  
to resist forces applied to it without breaking.

In this sense, resilience is the opposite of `fragility`.

::: 
::: column
:::info-box
In psychology, resilience does not mean simply resisting damage.

Resilience is the ability to:

- React `actively` to adverse or traumatic events  
- Reorganize one’s life in a positive way  
- Continue developing despite difficulties  

Resilience involves `adaptation`, not endurance alone.
:::

::: 
::: 

## The Kauai longitudinal study

::: columns
::: column

The concept of resilience entered psychology through a landmark [longitudinal study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study).

`Werner (1993)` followed the entire cohort of children born in 1955 on the island of Kauai (about 700 individuals, for more than 40 years).

:::info-box
About 1/3 of these children were exposed to:

- Social disadvantage  
- Family instability  
- Environmental stress  

As a group, this population showed a higher `incidence` of psychological distress.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Despite high risk exposure:

- One third of these children developed `normally`  
- They formed stable relationships  
- Showed good work performance  
- Demonstrated sociability and altruism  

These individuals were defined as `resilient`.
:::

:::card
What differentiated resilient individuals  
from those who succumbed to early adversity?
:::

::: 
::: 

## From risk to protection

::: columns
::: column

Possible factors included:

- Genetics  
- Life experiences  
- Protective environmental factors  

:::info-box
These findings shifted research focus:

From identifying `risk factors`  
to identifying `protective factors`.

The question became:

How does the brain adapt successfully to adversity?
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/gxe_factors.png){width="290" fig-align="center"}

:::card
To study mechanisms of resilience,  
animal models are essential.

One widely used model is `social defeat stress`.
:::

::: 
::: 

## Resilience as an active process

::: columns
::: column

>Resilience is not simply the absence of pathology.
It involves `active and adaptive processes`.
These include specific molecular and circuit-level changes.

:::info-box
Resilience involves both:

- `Passive resilience`  
  Absence of maladaptive molecular responses  
  seen in vulnerable individuals  

- `Active resilience`  
  Presence of adaptive plastic changes  
  seen `only` in resilient individuals  
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box

Both forms of resilience depend on `neuroplasticity`.

Plastic changes allow the brain to:

- Adjust stress responses  
- Reorganize circuits  
- Maintain functional behavior  

Resilience is biologically implemented.
:::

## Genetic factors and behavior

::: columns
::: column

Understanding how genetic factors contribute  
to behavior and its disorders is a central problem in neuroscience.

:::info-box
[Caspi et al. (2006)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1925) described three main approaches to study this relationship:

- Gene-to-disorder approach  
- Endophenotype-to-disorder approach  
- Gene–environment interaction approach  
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/gxe_approaches.webp){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Gene-to-disorder

::: columns
::: column

The `gene-to-disorder` approach assumes:

- A direct, `linear relationship` between genes and disorders  
- Genes are the primary cause of disorders  

:::info-box
This approach used:

- Linkage analysis  
- `Association studies`  

It searched for correlations between:

- Psychiatric diagnoses  
- Individual differences in DNA sequence  
:::

::: 
::: column

    class Genes,Disorder simple
    linkStyle 0 stroke:#9f8ca0,stroke-width:3px,fill:#9f8ca0
```

:::info-box
Although a few genes showed replicated associations:

- `Replication failures` were common  
- Progress was slow and inconsistent  

Many researchers abandoned the search  
for direct `main effects` of genotype on diagnosis.


:::

::: 
::: 

## Endophenotype-to-disorder

::: columns
::: column

The `endophenotype-to-disorder` approach introduced  
intermediate [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype).

>[Endophenotypes]{.highlight} are heritable biological traits associated with disorders.

:::info-box
They can be:

- Physiological  
- Biochemical  
- Anatomical

Example: macrocephaly or immune alterations in `ASD`.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
This approach assumes that:

- Endophenotypes have clearer genetic bases  
- Genes exert stronger effects on intermediate traits  
  than on complex diagnoses

::: 
::: 

## Gene–environment interaction (G × E)

::: columns
::: column

The `gene–environment interaction (G × E)` approach  
explicitly includes environmental factors.

:::info-box
The G × E approach assumes that:

- Environmental risk factors can contribute to disorders  
- Genotype `modulates susceptibility` to these factors  

Genes influence sensitivity to the environment.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
According to the G × E framework:

- There may be no gene-behavior association  
  in the absence of environmental stressors  

- There may be no environmental effect  
  without genetic susceptibility  

Risk emerges from their interaction.

:::

## Genes as risk factors

::: columns
::: column

In this view:

- Genes are not causative  
- They increase the `probability` of developing a disorder  

Only under specific environmental conditions.

:::info-box
Genetic and environmental factors:

- Are both risk factors  
- Act together  
- Increase vulnerability when combined  

Exposure does not guarantee pathology.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Genes:

- Define neural circuit potential  
- Also define limits of environmental influence  

The environment:

- Acts on genetic circuits  
- Shapes them toward maturity  
:::

:::card
Donald `Hebb` summarized this relationship clearly.
Asked whether genes or environment matter more, he replied:
Is the `height` or the `width` more important to calculate the area of a rectangle?

:::


::: 
::: 

## Polymorphisms as risk and protective factors

::: columns
::: column

>A `polymorphism` is a variation in DNA sequence present in more than `1%` of the population.

Polymorphisms can involve:

- Substitution of DNA bases  
- Deletion of DNA bases  
- Insertion of DNA bases  

They do not cause disease by themselves.


::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Polymorphisms can act as:

- `Risk factors`  
- `Protective factors`  

Their effect depends on the environment.

This fits the `gene–environment interaction` framework.
:::

![](images/gxe_polymorphism.jpg){width="250" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Childhood maltreatment and antisocial behavior

::: columns
::: column

`Childhood maltreatment` is a strong and universal risk factor for antisocial behavior. However:

- Not all maltreated children develop antisocial outcomes  
- Responses to maltreatment vary widely  

This variability suggests biological moderation.

:::info-box
Caspi et al. (2002) focused on the `MAOA` gene.

The [MAOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A) gene:

- Is located on the `X chromosome`  
- Codes for the [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) monoamine oxidase A  
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The MAOA enzyme is involved in the [catabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism) of [monoamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter):

- Dopamine  
- Norepinephrine  
- Serotonin  

It makes these neurotransmitters `inactive`.
:::

![](images/gxe_maoa.jpg){width="450" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## MAOA polymorphism

::: columns
::: column

A functional polymorphism affects MAOA activity.
`Low-activity MAOA` variants:

- Degrade monoamines less efficiently  
- Allow neurotransmitters to persist longer  
- Increase synaptic signaling

:::info-box
In mice:

- Silencing the MAOA gene increases aggression
- Restoring MAOA expression normalizes aggression  

This shows a causal link in regulating aggression.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
In humans:

- A rare null mutation of MAOA was linked  
  to antisocial behavior in a Dutch family  

Because MAOA is X-linked:

- Affected males had no functional enzyme  
- This acted as a human [knockout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout) 

This mutation is `extremely rare`.
:::

:::info-box
In most individuals:

- MAOA is present  
- But its activity varies
:::

::: 
::: 

## The Dunedin longitudinal study

![](images/gxe_dunedin.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

::: columns
::: column

Caspi et al. tested this hypothesis  
in the `Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study`.

This cohort includes:

- 1,037 individuals  
- Born in 1972–1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand  

Participants were followed from childhood into adulthood.

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The study had three major strengths:

- The cohort represents the general population.
- Well-characterized adversity
- Antisocial behavior was assessed using multiple sources
:::

::: 
:::

## Gene-environment interaction

::: columns
::: column

In the absence of maltreatment:

- Both MAOA genotypes showed low antisocial behavior  

The polymorphism alone was not sufficient.

:::info-box
When maltreatment occurred:

- Antisocial behavior increased in all individuals  
- The increase was much stronger  
  in low-activity MAOA individuals  

The curves diverged only under adversity.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
If the environment is protective:

- The genotype does not produce antisocial behavior  

Maltreatment is necessary for the genetic effect to emerge.

Although only `12%` of males had both:

- Low-activity MAOA  
- Childhood maltreatment  

They accounted for `44%` of violent convictions.

:::

::: 
::: 

## Gene-environment interaction

::: columns
::: column
![](images/gxe_maoa_antisocial.png){width="600" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Among severely maltreated males:

- `85%` with low-activity MAOA  
  developed antisocial behavior  

Risk increased, but outcomes were not inevitable.
:::

:::info-box
Pathogenesis is `multifactorial`.

It is:

- Not purely genetic  
- Not purely environmental  

Risk emerges from their interaction.
:::

::: 
::: 

## Life stress and depression

::: columns
::: column

Across the lifespan, `stressful life events` involving:

- Threat  
- Loss  
- Humiliation  
- Defeat  

strongly influence the onset and course of `depression`.

However, not everyone exposed to stress becomes depressed.

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Caspi et al. proposed that:

- Stressful life events act as an `environmental risk factor`  
- Genetic variation moderates individual sensitivity to stress  

This follows the `gene–environment interaction` framework.

**Core features**  
- Depressed mood
- Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia)

**Diagnostic criteria (≥ 5 for ≥ 2 weeks)**  
- Depressed mood
- Anhedonia
- Sleep disturbance
- Appetite or weight change
- Psychomotor agitation or retardation
- Fatigue
- Feelings of worthlessness or guilt

**Clinical notes**  
- Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment  
- Not attributable to substances or medical conditions  
- No history of manic or hypomanic episodes
:::
:::

## The candidate gene: 5-HTT

::: columns
::: column

>The gene under study codes for the [serotonin](3_synapse.html#serotonin) transporter (`5-HTT`).
The transporter regulates serotonin `reuptake` at the synapse.

The serotonin system is relevant to depression because:

- It is the target of [SSRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) antidepressant drugs  
- It modulates mood, stress reactivity, and emotion regulation  

This makes 5-HTT a plausible candidate gene.

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The 5-HTT gene contains a `polymorphism` in its promoter region  
called `5-HTTLPR`. Two main variants exist: `Long (l)` and `Short (s)` allele.  
:::

The `short` allele is associated with:

- Lower transcriptional efficiency  
- Reduced serotonin transporter expression  

:::info-box
Genotypes:

- `l/l`: high transporter expression  
- `s/l`: intermediate expression  
- `s/s`: low expression
:::

::: 
::: 

## Non-human primates

::: columns
::: column

In [rhesus macaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque):

- The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is analogous to humans  

The `short allele` is associated with:

- Reduced serotonergic function  
- Abnormal [HPA](7_emotion_motivation.html#hpa) response

>Only in monkeys reared in `stressful conditions`
No effect is seen in normally reared monkeys.

:::

## The Dunedin study on MDD

::: columns
::: column

Different types of stressful life events between ages `21 and 26` were assessed.
Among participants:

- `30%` experienced no stressful events  
- `20%` experienced two events  
- `11%` experienced three events  
- `15%` experienced four or more events  

:::info-box
There was:

- No significant main effect of genotype  
- A significant `gene–environment interaction`  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
As the number of stressful life events increased:

- Risk of depression increased in all individuals  
- The increase was much steeper in `s/s` individuals  
- `l/l` individuals were relatively protected
:::

:::card
In the absence of stressful life events: All genotypes showed similar levels of depression  
The gene alone was not sufficient.
:::

::: 
::: 

## No stress, no difference

![](images/gxe_htt_mdd.png){width="550" fig-align="center"}

## Suicide and early life adversity outcomes

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Similar interaction effects were observed for:

- Suicidal ideation  
- Suicide attempts  

Stress predicted these outcomes mainly in `s/s` individuals.
:::

:::info-box
The interaction also showed a correlation with early life adversities:

- Childhood maltreatment predicted adult depression  
- Only in individuals carrying an `s` allele  
- Not in `l/l` homozygotes 
:::

::: 
::: column

::: 
::: 

## Dopamine and reward sensitivity

::: columns
::: column

Individual differences in reward sensitivity  
can be partly influenced by genetic variation.

One candidate gene is the `DRD4` gene.

:::info-box
The `DRD4` gene codes for the `D4 dopamine receptor`.

This receptor is involved in:

- Dopamine signaling  
- Pleasure and gratification  
- Motivation and reward sensitivity  
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The DRD4 gene shows a functional polymorphism.
Two main variants are often considered:

- `Long (L)` allele  
- `Short (S)` allele  

The `L` variant is considered `hypofunctional`.
:::

:::card
The DRD4 polymorphism appears to influence the `salience` of appetitive stimuli

- The order of conditions was counterbalanced

**Results**  
Participants with the `L/L` genotype: reported a stronger desire to continue drinking, but `only` after the alcoholic condition
Participants with the `S/S` genotype showed no difference between conditions.  

:::

## Not only for Alcohol

![](images/gxe_smoking.png){width="550" fig-align="center"}

## Other GxE interactions: Cannabis Use

::: columns
::: column

:::card
Early use of `cannabis`, especially during `adolescence`, is associated with an increased risk of `psychosis`.
:::
:::info-box
This includes:

- Transient psychotic symptoms  
- Clinically relevant disorders  
- Diagnosis of schizophrenia  
:::

>But most individuals who use cannabis do **not** develop psychosis. This suggests that cannabis exposure alone  
is `not sufficient`.

::: 
::: column

>One candidate gene is `COMT`.

:::info-box
The `COMT` gene codes for `catechol-O-methyltransferase`.

This enzyme is involved in the degradation of `Dopamine`  

COMT activity is particularly important  
in the `prefrontal cortex`.
:::

:::info-box
A functional polymorphism exists in the COMT gene:

- `MET` allele  (high activity)
- `VAL` allele  (low activity)

:::

::: 
:::

## Early gene-environment interactions

::: columns
::: column

Gene-environment interactions are especially powerful  
during `early development`.

Early experiences can shape long-term cognitive  
and emotional outcomes.

:::info-box
One of the most influential projects in this area is the  
`Bucharest Early Intervention (BEI) Project`.

This study examined the effects of early psychosocial deprivation  
on child development.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/gxe_beip.jpg){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
The BEI Project studied children raised in  
Romanian orphanages.

These children experienced:

- Severe social deprivation  
- Limited caregiver interaction

## A genetic moderator

::: columns
::: column

>Despite overall benefits, children differed in their degree of recovery.

Drury et al. (2010) investigated whether genetic variation  
could explain differences in recovery. They focused on the `COMT val158met` polymorphism.

:::info-box
The study included `136` children from the BEI Project. Procedure:

- At `2.5 years`: children assigned to foster care or institution  
- At `4.5 years`: psychiatric assessment 
- Genotyping for `COMT val158met`  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Among children who `remained` institutionalized:

- Carriers of the `MET` allele showed fewer depressive symptoms  
- `VAL/VAL` homozygotes showed higher symptoms

:::

:::info-box
Among children placed in foster care:

- `VAL/VAL` children improved dramatically  
- Their depressive symptoms dropped  
- They reached levels similar to `MET/MET` children  

Positive environments had a strong impact.

:::

::: 
::: 

## A key insight

::: columns
::: column

The children who appeared most vulnerable  
benefited the most from a supportive environment.

>This is not simple vulnerability. This is `plasticity`.

:::info-box
This study was among the first to show:

- Genetic differences predict `recovery`  
- Positive environments can `override` early adversity  
- G × E applies to `improvement`, not only to risk  

:::


::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Many G × E studies focused mainly on:

- Stress  
- Negative life events  

They paid less attention to positive environments.
:::

:::card
The `differential susceptibility model`  
(Belsky et al., 2007; Belsky & Pluess, 2009)  
proposes a different perspective.

:::

::: 
::: 


## The differential susceptibility model

::: columns
::: column

Individuals differ in their susceptibility to:

- Negative environments  
- Positive environments  

The same genotype can amplify both.

:::info-box
Genetic variants are better described as:

- `Plasticity variants`  

Rather than:

- Risk genes  
- Vulnerability genes  

They increase environmental responsiveness.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/gxe_differential_susceptibility_model.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::card
The idea that individuals are genetically determined  
(except for rare genetic diseases) is incorrect.
:::

::: 
::: 

## Open questions

::: columns
::: column

We still do not fully understand:

- Why some genotypes are more plastic  
- Which neural circuits are involved  
- How genes and environments interact at the brain level  

:::info-box
Progress requires studies linking:

- Genetic variation  
- Environmental exposure  
- Brain mechanisms  
- Behavioral outcomes  

Across development.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::card
Conclusions

Mental disorders and individual differences  
must be studied through `gene–environment interactions`.

>We cannot change genes.
But we can improve environments.
Prevention is a powerful intervention.
