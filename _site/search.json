It transforms goals and intentions into coordinated muscle activity.\n\n\n\n\nProducing movement requires:\n\nSelecting an action\n\nPlanning its structure\n\nExecuting motor commands\n\nMonitoring outcomes\n\nThese processes are distributed across multiple brain regions.\n\n\n\nKey components of the motor system include:\n\nMotor cortex\nBasal ganglia\n\nCerebellum\nBrainstem\n\nSpinal cord\n\nThey interact continuously during movement."

Neurons in M1 are the upper motor neurons and send commands toward the spinal cord.\n\nPrimary motor cortex is organized somatotopically. Different body parts are represented in different cortical regions. Fine motor control occupies more cortical space.\n\n\n\nEncode patterns of movement such as:\n\nDirection\n\nForce\n\nCoordination\n\nMovement emerges from population activity.\n\n\n\nSignals from motor cortex descend to the spinal cord. These pathways convey voluntary motor commands. Control is largely contralateral.\n\n\nThe spinal cord is the main site of motor execution. It integrates descending commands with sensory input."

    "text": "What is Resilience\n\n\nThe term resilience originally comes from metallurgy.\n\nIt refers to the ability of a material\nto resist forces applied to it without breaking.\n\nIn this sense, resilience is the opposite of fragility.\n\n\nIn psychology, resilience does not mean simply resisting damage.\nResilience is the ability to:\n\nReact actively to adverse or traumatic events\n\nReorganize one’s life in a positive way\n\nContinue developing despite difficulties\n\nResilience involves adaptation, not endurance alone."

These include specific molecular and circuit-level changes.\n\n\nResilience involves both:\n\nPassive resilience\nAbsence of maladaptive molecular responses\nseen in vulnerable individuals\nActive resilience\nPresence of adaptive plastic changes\nseen only in resilient individuals\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth forms of resilience depend on neuroplasticity.\nPlastic changes allow the brain to:\n\nAdjust stress responses\n\nReorganize circuits\n\nMaintain functional behavior\n\nResilience is biologically implemented."
