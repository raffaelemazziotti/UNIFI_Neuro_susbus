## What is Resilience

::: columns
::: column

The term `resilience` originally comes from metallurgy.

>It refers to the ability of a material  
to resist forces applied to it without breaking.

In this sense, resilience is the opposite of `fragility`.

::: 
::: column
:::info-box
In psychology, resilience does not mean simply resisting damage.

Resilience is the ability to:

- React `actively` to adverse or traumatic events  
- Reorganize one’s life in a positive way  
- Continue developing despite difficulties  

Resilience involves `adaptation`, not endurance alone.

## The Kauai longitudinal study

::: columns
::: column

The concept of resilience entered psychology through  
a landmark [longitudinal study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study).

`Werner (1993)` followed the entire cohort of children  
born in 1955 on the island of Kauai (about 700 individuals for more than 40 years).

:::info-box
About 1/3 of these children were exposed to:

- Social disadvantage  
- Family instability  
- Environmental stress  

As a group, this population showed a higher `incidence`  
of psychological distress.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Despite high risk exposure:

- One third of these children developed `normally`  
- They formed stable relationships  
- Showed good work performance  
- Demonstrated sociability and altruism  

These individuals were defined as `resilient`.
:::

:::card
What differentiated resilient individuals  
from those who succumbed to early adversity?

## From risk to protection

::: columns
::: column

Possible factors included:

- Genetics  
- Life experiences  
- Protective environmental factors  

:::info-box
These findings shifted research focus:

From identifying `risk factors`  
to identifying `protective factors`.

The question became:

How does the brain adapt successfully to adversity?
:::

:::card
To study mechanisms of resilience,  
animal models are essential.

One widely used model is `social defeat stress`.

## Resilience as an active process

::: columns
::: column

>Resilience is not simply the absence of pathology.
It involves `active and adaptive processes`.
These include specific molecular and circuit-level changes.

:::info-box
Resilience involves both:

- `Passive resilience`  
  Absence of maladaptive molecular responses  
  seen in vulnerable individuals  

- `Active resilience`  
  Presence of adaptive plastic changes  
  seen `only` in resilient individuals  
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box

Both forms of resilience depend on `neuroplasticity`.

Plastic changes allow the brain to:

- Adjust stress responses  
- Reorganize circuits  
- Maintain functional behavior  

Resilience is biologically implemented.

## Genetic factors and behavior

::: columns
::: column

Understanding how genetic factors contribute  
to behavior and its disorders is a central problem in neuroscience.

:::info-box
[Caspi et al. (2006)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1925) described three main approaches  
to study this relationship:

- Gene-to-disorder approach  
- Endophenotype-to-disorder approach  
- Gene–environment interaction approach  
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/gxe_approaches.webp){width="500" fig-align="center"}

## Gene-to-disorder

::: columns
::: column

The `gene-to-disorder` approach assumes:

- A direct, `linear relationship` between genes and disorders  
- Genes are the primary cause of disorders  

:::info-box
This approach used:

- Linkage analysis  
- `Association studies`  

It searched for correlations between:

- Psychiatric diagnoses  
- Individual differences in DNA sequence

    linkStyle 0 stroke:#9f8ca0,stroke-width:3px,fill:#9f8ca0
```

:::info-box
Although a few genes showed replicated associations:

- `Replication failures` were common  
- Progress was slow and inconsistent  

Many researchers abandoned the search  
for direct `main effects` of genotype on diagnosis.


:::

::: 
::: 

## Endophenotype-to-disorder

::: columns
::: column

The `endophenotype-to-disorder` approach introduced  
intermediate [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype).

>[Endophenotypes]{.highlight} are heritable biological traits associated with disorders.

:::info-box
They can be:

- Physiological  
- Biochemical  
- Anatomical

Example: macrocephaly or immune alterations in `ASD`.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
This approach assumes that:

- Endophenotypes have clearer genetic bases  
- Genes exert stronger effects on intermediate traits  
  than on complex diagnoses

## Gene–environment interaction (G × E)

::: columns
::: column

The `gene–environment interaction (G × E)` approach  
explicitly includes environmental factors.

:::info-box
The G × E approach assumes that:

- Environmental risk factors can contribute to disorders  
- Genotype `modulates susceptibility` to these factors  

Genes influence sensitivity to the environment.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
According to the G × E framework:

- There may be no gene-behavior association  
  in the absence of environmental stressors  

- There may be no environmental effect  
  without genetic susceptibility  

Risk emerges from their interaction.

## Genes as risk factors

::: columns
::: column

In this view:

- Genes are not causative  
- They increase the `probability` of developing a disorder  

Only under specific environmental conditions.

:::info-box
Genetic and environmental factors:

- Are both risk factors  
- Act together  
- Increase vulnerability when combined  

Exposure does not guarantee pathology.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Genes:

- Define neural circuit potential  
- Also define limits of environmental influence  

The environment:

- Acts on genetic circuits  
- Shapes them toward maturity  
:::

:::card
Donald `Hebb` summarized this relationship clearly.
Asked whether genes or environment matter more, he replied:
Is the `height` or the `width` more important to calculate the area of a rectangle?
