## What is the motor system

>The motor system allows the nervous system to generate movement.
It transforms goals and intentions into `coordinated muscle activity`.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Producing movement requires:

- `Selecting` an action  
- `Planning` its structure  
- `Executing` motor commands  
- `Monitoring` outcomes  

These processes are `distributed` across multiple brain regions.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Key components of the motor system include:

- [Motor cortex]{.highlight} 
- [Basal ganglia]{.highlight}  
- [Cerebellum]{.highlight} 
- [Brainstem]{.highlight}  
- [Spinal cord]{.highlight}  

They `interact` continuously during movement.
:::

:::
:::

## Primary motor cortex

>The [primary motor cortex (M1)]{.highlight} is the main `cortical output` of the motor system.
It is located in the `frontal lobe`, anterior to somatosensory cortex.
Neurons in M1 send commands toward the spinal cord.


Primary motor cortex is organized [somatotopically]().
Different body parts are represented in different cortical regions.
Fine motor control occupies more cortical space.


:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Encode patterns of movement such as:

- Direction  
- Force  
- Coordination  

Movement emerges from `population activity`.
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
Signals from motor cortex descend to the spinal cord.
These pathways convey `voluntary` motor commands.
Control is largely `contralateral`.
:::

:::card
The spinal cord is the main site of motor execution.
It integrates descending commands with sensory input.
:::

:::
:::

## From cortex to muscle

:::columns
:::column

>**Lower motor neurons** reside in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. 
They are the final common pathway for movement.
Their axons exit the CNS to innervate muscles.

:::info-box
Motor commands travel from:

- Motor cortex  
- Through descending pathways  
- To spinal motor neurons  
- To muscle fibers  

This pathway transforms intention into force.

## M1 is not enough

:::columns
:::column

Although M1 and the spinal cord can generate movement,
They do not decide `what` movement to make.
That requires additional motor areas.

:::info-box
Voluntary movement involves `choices`.

The nervous system must:

- Select appropriate actions  
- Organize sequences  
- Suppress unwanted movements  

Planning occurs before execution.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box

The [supplementary motor area (SMA)]{.highlight} supports internally generated actions.

It is critical for:

- `Self-initiated` movement  
- Sequencing  
- `Bimanual coordination`  

It organizes actions over time.

:::


The [premotor cortex]{.highlight} contributes to planning movements guided by `external cues`.
It links sensory information to motor commands.
It prepares movements before they are executed.


:::
:::

![](images/motor_cortical_areas.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

## Subcortical structures

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The **basal nuclei** regulate whether an action is initiated.

They are involved in:

- `Selecting` appropriate actions  
- `Suppressing` competing or unwanted actions  

They do not generate movement or send commands to muscles.

Their role is to `gate` motor plans.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
The **cerebellum** regulates how an action is executed.

It is involved in:

- `Coordination` and timing  
- `Error correction`  
- Motor `learning`  

It `compares` intended movement with actual outcome.

:::

:::
:::

## Cortical damage

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Damage to **primary motor cortex** produces:

- Weakness or paralysis  
- Loss of fine voluntary control  
- Deficits on the contralateral side  

`Reflexes` are generally preserved.

:::

:::
:::column


:::info-box
Damage to **premotor cortex** or **supplementary motor area** leads to:

- Difficulty planning movements  
- Impaired sequencing or initiation  
- [Apraxia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprassia) despite preserved strength  

The problem is planning, not execution.
:::

:::
:::

## Basal nuclei damage

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Damage to the **basal nuclei** disrupts action selection.

This can result in:

- Difficulty initiating movement  
- Excessive or involuntary movements  

Strength is usually preserved.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Basal nuclei dysfunction in [Parkinsonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease) disorders leads to:

- [Bradykinesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokinesia)  
- Rigidity  
- Resting tremor  

Movement is difficult to `initiate`, not to execute.
:::

:::
:::

## Cerebellar damage

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

Damage to the **cerebellum** causes:

- Poor coordination  
- Inaccurate movements  
- Timing deficits  

Strength is preserved, but movement is imprecise.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Cerebellar ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_ataxia): 

- Unsteady gait  
- [Dysmetria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmetria)  
- Intention tremor  

`Errors increase` during movement.

:::

:::
:::

## Motor neuron lesions

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Damage to **upper motor neurons** leads to:

- Weakness  
- Increased muscle tone  
- Hyperreflexia  

This reflects loss of inhibitory control.
:::

:::info-box
Damage to **lower motor neurons** causes:

- Flaccid paralysis  
- Muscle atrophy  
- Loss of reflexes  

The final output pathway is disrupted.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/motor_motneu_up_low.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Spinal cord and peripheral nerve damage

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Spinal cord lesions produce:

- Weakness below the lesion  
- Loss of voluntary control  
- Patterned sensory and motor deficits  

The level of the lesion matters.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Damage to peripheral nerves results in:

- Weakness in specific muscles  
- Loss of reflexes  
- Sensory deficits in nerve territory 

Deficits follow peripheral anatomy.
