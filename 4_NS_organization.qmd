## Organization of the Nervous System

The nervous system is organized into distinct [anatomical]{.highlight} and [functional]{.highlight} divisions.
It is composed of interconnected networks that work in tight coordination to support vital, sensory, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functions.

::: columns
::: column
> [Anatomical]{.highlight} division classifies the nervous system based on `physical structures` and location

:::
::: column

> [Functional]{.highlight} division classifies the nervous system based on the type of `information` processed

:::
:::

## Anatomical Directions
::: columns
::: column

::: {.nonincremental}
- `Rostral` or `Anterior`: toward the front  
- `Caudal` or `Posterior`: toward the back  
:::

- `Ventral`: toward the bottom  
:::

::: {.nonincremental}

Brain and spinal cord  
:::

::: info-box
**Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**  
Nerves and ganglia outside the CNS  
:::

:::
::: column

:::
:::

## Central Nervous System (CNS)

::: columns
::: column
::: info-box
The CNS includes:

- Brain  
- Spinal cord  
:::

::: info-box
Neurons in the CNS are responsible for:

- Behavioural output  
:::

> The CNS is protected by bone, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid.

:::
::: column
![](images/SN_org_CNS.jpg){width="450" fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

## Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

::: columns
::: column
The PNS includes:

::: info-box

- Autonomic NS  
- Somatic NS  
:::

> Its main role is `communication` between the body and the CNS.

::: info-box
Information flows in two directions:

- `Afferent`: From body to CNS
- `Efferent`: From CNS to body
:::

::: 
::: column
![](images/SN_org_PNS.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}

## Somatic nervous system

::: columns
::: column
The **somatic nervous system**:

::: info-box
**Efferent Signals**

- Skeletal muscles  
- Voluntary movement 

:::

::: info-box
**Afferent Signals**

- Skin  
- Muscles and Joints 

This includes the sense of touch, temperature, pain, and [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception).
:::



::: 
::: column
> Activity in this system is **usually** under `conscious` perception and `voluntary` control.

![](images/SN_org_reflex_arc.png){width="500" fig-align="right"}

::: 
::: 

## Autonomic nervous system

::: columns
::: column
The **autonomic nervous system** regulates internal physiology.

::: info-box
It controls:

- Vital functions (Heart rate, breathing...) 
- Smooth muscle (Digestion, salivation...)
- Glands (Hormones...) 
:::

> Most autonomic activity occurs `without` conscious awareness.
> It is composed of two main branches: `Sympathetic` and `Parasympathetic`.

::: 
::: column

![](images/SN_org_ANS.jpg){width="470" fig-align="right"}

::: 
::: 

## Sympathetic nervous system

::: columns
::: column

The **sympathetic nervous system** prepares the body for action [Fight or Flight]{.highlight} Response.

:::info-box
Activation of the sympathetic system typically leads to:

- Increased heart rate  
- Bronchodilation  
- Reduced digestive activity  
- Mobilization of glucose  
:::

> Increase the `Arousal` level. These effects support physical and cognitive demands.

::: 
::: column

![](images/SN_org_ANS.jpg){width="470" fig-align="right"}

::: 
::: 

## Parasympathetic nervous system

::: columns
::: column
The **parasympathetic nervous system** promotes maintenance and recovery. [Rest and Digest]{.highlight} Response.

:::info-box
Activation of the parasympathetic system typically leads to:

- Decreased heart rate  
- Increased digestive activity  
- Energy storage  
- Glandular secretion  
:::

> Decrease the `Arousal` level. These effects support recovery and homeostasis.

::: 
::: column

![](images/SN_org_ANS.jpg){width="470" fig-align="right"}

## The cerebrum

::: columns
::: column

The cerebrum is divided into two `hemispheres` (Left and Right)
The hemispheres are connected by large bundles of axons (`Corpus Callosum`).

::: info-box

- Cognition and language  
- Conscious awareness  
:::

> Despite strong similarities, the two hemispheres are `not` functionally identical.
