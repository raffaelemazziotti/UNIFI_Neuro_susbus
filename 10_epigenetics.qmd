## Epigenetics and behavior

::: columns
::: column

Epigenetic mechanisms have attracted great interest in the study of `behavior` and `mental disorders`.

>They help explain how experiences, especially early in life,  
can have long-lasting effects on brain function.

:::info-box

Epigenetic mechanisms can explain:

- Why early `experiences` can have lifelong effects  
- Why  `stress` can also shape behavior  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms allow:

- Transient experiences  
- To produce long-term biological effects  

They provide a way for plasticity  
to be maintained over time.
:::

## Epigenetic mechanisms

::: columns
::: column

There are several epigenetic mechanisms.
Two of the most studied are:

- `Histone acetylation`  
- `DNA methylation`  

:::info-box
Epigenetics was originally developed  
to explain how cellular traits are inherited  
without changes in DNA sequence.

This was crucial in:

- Developmental biology  
- Cell differentiation  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
During development we have undifferentiated cells ([stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell)):

- Cells are initially `totipotent`  
- Then become `multipotent`  
- Finally become `specialized`  

This occurs through epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
As cells encounter specific signals:

- Some genes are `silenced`  
- Others are `activated`  

The gene remains present, but epigenetic modulate its expression.

:::

::: 
::: 

## Epigenetics in neurons

::: columns
::: column

In neurons:

- Epigenetic changes are maintained  
  at the level of the `individual cell`
- They provide long-term regulation of neuronal function.

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms are now considered crucial for:

- Long-term behavioral change  
- Resilience and vulnerability  
- Adaptive and maladaptive plasticity  

They link experience to lasting brain change.

:::


::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms are processes that:

- Alter `gene expression`  
- Without changing the `DNA sequence`  

They act through chromatin remodeling.
:::

![](images/epigen_chromatin.png){width="600" fig-align="center"}

::: 
:::

## Chromatin
::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Think of chromatin as a `spool of thread`:

- `Thread` = DNA  
- `Spool` = histone proteins  

DNA wraps around histones.
:::

:::info-box
`Chromatin` is the combination of:

- DNA  
- Histone proteins  

Its structure determines whether genes  
are accessible for transcription.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_chromatin_2.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Chromatin states
::: columns
::: column

Chromatin can be:

| State        | [Transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `Inactive`   | Not accessible    |
| `Repressed`  | Low               |
| `Permissive` | Medium            |
| `Active`     | High              |

## DNA methylation

::: columns
::: column

`DNA methylation`:

- Adds a methyl group (`CH3`) to DNA  
- Acts as a transcriptional stop signal  

When methylation is present:

- Transcription machinery is blocked  

:::info-box
Life experiences can modify:

- Which regions of DNA are methylated  

This changes transcription probability  
without altering DNA sequence.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Studies of [monozygotic twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin) show:

- At early age, epigenetic patterns are similar  
- Later in life, patterns diverge  

Experience leaves an epigenetic signature.
:::

## Evidence from twins

![](images/epigen_dna_methylation_twins.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

## Histone modifications

::: columns
::: column

:::card
Histone proteins are not static.

They can undergo `post-translational modifications` after they are synthesized.

These modifications change how histones interact with DNA.
:::

:::info-box
A histone modification is a `chemical change` added to histone proteins.

These changes:

- Do `not` alter DNA sequence  
- `Alter chromatin structure`  
- Modify gene transcription probability  

They act as `regulatory` signals.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Histone modifications determine:

- How tightly DNA is packed  
- Whether a gene is accessible  

They regulate gene expression dynamically.
:::

![](images/epigen_histone_modification.gif){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Histone modifications

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Common histone post-translational modifications include:

- `Acetylation`  
- `Methylation`  
- `Phosphorylation`  
- `Ubiquitination`  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Histone modifications do not act in isolation.

Each modification can alter chromatin structure or recruit specific regulatory proteins. In a much more complex way.
Different combinations of modifications  
create a [histone code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_code). This code:

- Fine-tunes gene expression  
- Allows flexible and context-dependent regulation  
:::


::: 
::: 

![](images/epigen_histone_code.png){width="700" fig-align="center"}

## Histone modifications

::: columns
::: column

:::card
`Histone acetylation` is one type of histone modification. It consists of adding an `acetyl group` to specific regions of histone proteins.

:::

:::info-box
Histone acetylation:

- Makes chromatin `less compact`  
- Increases DNA accessibility  
- Increases Genes expression  

:::

::: 
::: column


![](images/epigen_acetylation.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

## Chronic social defeat stress

::: columns
::: column

`Chronic social defeat stress` is an animal model  
used to study stress, depression-like behavior,  
and resilience.

:::info-box
The model involves:

- A `dominant` male mouse  
- A `subordinate` male mouse  

The subordinate mouse is placed  
in the cage of the dominant one.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_social_defeat.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}


::: 
::: 

## Persistent stress exposure

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
- The dominant mouse forces subordination  
- The subordinate experiences social defeat  

This interaction lasts:

- `10 minutes per day`  
- For `10 consecutive days`  
:::

:::info-box
When separated:

- The mice remain in visual contact  
- They can smell each other  

Stress therefore continues  
even outside direct interaction.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Only protocols lasting at least `10 days`:

- Induce stable depression-like behavior  
- Produce [anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)-like symptoms  

Shorter protocols are insufficient.
:::

:::info-box
Chronic social defeat produces:

- Strong experience of subordination  
- Reduced motivation for social interaction  

This is measured `quantitatively`.

:::

::: 
::: 

## Measuring anhedonia

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Anhedonia is assessed using a  
`social interaction task`.

The task measures:

- Time spent exploring a conspecific  
- Willingness to engage socially  
:::

:::info-box
Compared to controls:

- Defeated mice explore less  
- Show social withdrawal  

The distribution shifts toward  
reduced social interaction.
:::

::: 
::: column

```

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
After social defeat:

- `Susceptible` mice show social withdrawal  
- `Resilient` mice behave like controls  

There is a continuum between the two poles.
:::

::: 
::: 

![](images/epigen_social_defeal_resilient.png){width="550" fig-align="center"}

## Effect of chronic stress

::: columns
::: column

>What determines vulnerability or resilience?

:::info-box
Genetic differences are unlikely:

- These mice belong to the same strain  

This points to `non-genetic mechanisms`.
:::

:::info-box
Differences may arise from:

- `Epigenetic regulation`  
- `Experience-dependent plasticity`

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Under normal conditions:

- The `BDNF` gene is highly expressed  
- Chromatin is open  
- Histones are acetylated  

This supports hippocampal plasticity.
:::

:::info-box
After chronic social defeat:

- Chromatin becomes more compact
- Histone acetylation decreases  

`BDNF expression` and plasticity in the hippocampus are reduced.

:::



::: 
::: 

## Effect of chronic stress

::: columns
::: column
![](images/epigen_social_defeat_bdnf.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Reduced hippocampal BDNF leads to:

- Reduced neurogenesis  
- Reduced synaptic plasticity  
- Impaired hippocampal function  

This contributes to anhedonic behavior.
:::

::: 
::: 

## Antidepressant treatment

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
After antidepressant treatment:

- Histone acetylation increases  
- BDNF transcription partially recovers  

However:

- DNA methylation remains  
:::

:::info-box
Stress-induced epigenetic changes:

- Persist after stress ends  
- Are only partially reversible  

These changes act as `molecular scars`.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_social_defeat_bdnf2.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Molecular Scar

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
If antidepressant treatment stops:

- BDNF reduction reappears  

The epigenetic trace of stress remains.

:::

:::info-box
Chronic stress:

- Alters neural circuits  
- Leaves latent molecular marks  

Recovery is possible,  
but not complete.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_social_defeat_bdnf2.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## VTA–NAc circuit and resilience

::: columns
::: column

> The hippocampal effects are not the only mechanism involved.

:::info-box
After social defeat vulnerable mice show:

- Hyperactive VTA dopamine neurons  
- NAc becomes `overstimulated`
:::

:::info-box
Resilient mice:

- Upregulate `potassium channels` in the VTA  
- Reduce dopamine neuron firing preventing chronic NAc overstimulation.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_NAc_overstim.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
The activation of NAc follows a homeostatic principle:

- Acute dopamine → pleasure  
- Chronic dopamine → saturation → anhedonia

:::

::: 
::: 

## Active resilience

::: columns
::: column

> These findings indicate that resilience is not merely the absence of adverse effects. Rather, it reflects an active process, with specific mechanisms shaping distinct outcomes.

:::card
Can resilience be induced?

Yes.

Vulnerable animals can become resilient  
by targeting adaptive mechanisms.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Ezogabine, a drug enhancing potassium channels:

- Reduced depressive and anhedonic symptoms  
- Normalized reward circuit connectivity  

:::

![](images/epigen_ezogabine.jpg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Plasticity needs guidance

::: columns
::: column

>Drugs can increase plasticity. But plasticity is `undirected`. The environment determines the outcome.

:::card
SSRIs increase serotonin rapidly. Clinical effects appear slowly. This suggests involvement of `slow plastic mechanisms`.
:::

:::info-box
SSRIs:

- Increase neural plasticity  
- Create a window for change  

The environment drives whether changes are  
adaptive or maladaptive.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_env_effects.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
Fluoxetine-treated mice:

- Improved in enriched environments  
- Worsened in stressful environments  

The drug increased sensitivity to `context`.

:::

::: 
::: 

## Early developmental environment and epigenetics

::: columns
::: column

>Early life experiences can have `long-lasting effects` on behavior.
> These effects are often mediated by `epigenetic mechanisms`.

:::info-box
[M. Meaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Meaney) studied differences in `maternal behavior` in rats.

Mothers were classified based on:

- `Licking and grooming`  
- `Nursing posture`  

They are better described as `high-nurturing` or `low-nurturing` mothers.

:::


::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_mothering.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Early developmental environment and epigenetics

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Low-nurturing mothers:

- Feed offspring normally  
- Are not abusive

The difference lies in `interaction quality`, not basic care.
:::

:::info-box
Rats raised by `low-nurturing` mothers:

- Are more neophobic
- Have a chronically active HPA axis  
- Females often become low-nurturing mothers.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Rats raised by high-nurturing mothers:

- Are less `neophobic`
- Have a well-regulated `HPA axis`  
- Females often become high-nurturing mothers.

:::

![](images/epigne_maternal_styles.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## The stress system: HPA axis

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
The HPA axis involves:

- Hypothalamus → `CRH`  
- Pituitary → `ACTH`  
- Adrenal glands → `cortisol`  

Cortisol feeds back to the hippocampus.
:::

:::info-box
The hippocampus contains  
`glucocorticoid receptors (GR)`.

More GRs means:

- Faster negative feedback  
- Better stress regulation  

:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_hpa_regulaiton.png){width="450" fig-align="center"}


::: 
::: 

## Epigenetic programming of stress

::: columns
::: column

>Maternal care activates epigenetic mechanisms at the `GR gene` in the hippocampus.

:::info-box
High GR expression leads to:

- Efficient HPA self-regulation  
- Lower anxiety  
- Lower cortisol levels  

Low maternal care produces the opposite pattern. Early experience `programs`  
the long-term functionality of the HPA axis.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/epigen_hpa_gr.png){width="450" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Functional recovery

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
After [TSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichostatin_A) treatment:

- HPA axis responses normalized  
- Stress reactivity decreased  

The negative effects of low maternal care were  significantly reduced.

:::

:::info-box
Similar recovery occurs with:

- `Enriched environments`  
- Foster care  

Epigenetic scars may persist,  
but their functional impact can be reduced.
