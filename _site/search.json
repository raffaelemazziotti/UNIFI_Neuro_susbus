It transforms goals and intentions into coordinated muscle activity.\n\n\n\n\nProducing movement requires:\n\nSelecting an action\n\nPlanning its structure\n\nExecuting motor commands\n\nMonitoring outcomes\n\nThese processes are distributed across multiple brain regions.\n\n\n\nKey components of the motor system include:\n\nMotor cortex\nBasal ganglia\n\nCerebellum\nBrainstem\n\nSpinal cord\n\nThey interact continuously during movement."

Neurons in M1 send commands toward the spinal cord.\n\nPrimary motor cortex is organized somatotopically. Different body parts are represented in different cortical regions. Fine motor control occupies more cortical space.\n\n\n\nEncode patterns of movement such as:\n\nDirection\n\nForce\n\nCoordination\n\nMovement emerges from population activity.\n\n\n\nSignals from motor cortex descend to the spinal cord. These pathways convey voluntary motor commands. Control is largely contralateral.\n\n\nThe spinal cord is the main site of motor execution. It integrates descending commands with sensory input."

    "text": "The auditory system\n\nHearing allows the nervous system to detect and interpret sound. Sound is a pattern of pressure waves in airfrom 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Perception arises from how these waves are transformed into neural signals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound waves are characterized by:\n\nFrequency related to perceived pitch\n\nAmplitude related to perceived loudness."

The middle ear amplifies vibrations using 3 small bones. This amplification is essential for efficient sound transmission.\n\n\nThe inner ear contains the cochlea.\nInside the cochlea:\n\nSound vibrations create traveling waves\n\nDifferent frequencies peak at different locations\n\nThis spatial separation is fundamental to hearing."
