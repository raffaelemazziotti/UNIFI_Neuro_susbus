## What is Neuroplasticity

::: columns
::: column

The ability of the brain, of nervous circuits, to change in response to
experience is called `neuroplasticity`.

:::info-box
>The [effectiveness]{.highlight} of synaptic connections is changed by `experience`.

Experience changes the circuit’s electrical activity and this modifies the synaptic
effectiveness.

:::

## The complexity of the brain

::: columns
::: column

>100 billion neurons

>Up to 1000 synaptic inputs on a single neuron

>600 million connections/mm3

:::card
Our behavior, thoughts, actions, perception, ability to imagine or remember,
depend on the coordinated activation of multiple nervous circuits, which may
also include neurons located in different brain areas.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
`Genetics` and individual `experience`:

1) `Interact` and together guide the `development` of behavior and
of neural circuits supporting it
2) continue to interact `throughout life`, by guiding the plastic
changes induced by experience in the brain and therefore in
behavior, by shaping the way we "see" what surrounds us and the
way we react to it.

> Different experiences, different brains, different behaviors

## Neurodevelopment

![](images/plast_brain_prebirth.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

How long does neurodevelopment take?

>It doesn’t take 9 months.
At birth, the human brain is still
very immature.

::: columns
::: column

`29 days`: there is a tube (neural
tube)

`59 days`: has acquired a different
morphology in the most anterior
part (where the brain will appear)

::: 
::: column

`70 days`: the brain can be already
recognized

`6 months`: there are no
convolutions yet, there is not yet
enough surface to fold it, it is
smooth

`9 months`: it is still very immature.

::: 
::: 

## Neurodevelopment

![](images/plast_brain_dev.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
::: columns
::: column

- `Neurulation` - Neural tube induction of the NS
- `Neurogenesis` - generation of neurons
- `Synaptogenesis` - formation of Synapses

::: 
::: column

- `Apoptosis` – programmed cell death
- `Gliogenesis` - generation of glia
- `Myelination` - the axons are covered by myelin

::: 
::: 

:::

## Neurodevelopment

:::info-box
`Gene specification` has the role of guiding the `initial` processes of brain
development and formation of neural connections.
:::

:::info-box
The `specific experience` of the individual and his interactions with the
environment have the role of guiding the `final phases` of the development of
the brain circuits, leading them to the mature state and therefore guiding the
development of the different expressions of behavior in an individual-specific
way.

>Different experiences, different brains, different behaviors

## Neuroplasticity

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
[Synaptic Plasticity]{.higlight}

Synaptic plasticity refers to changes in the effectiveness of communication  
between a presynaptic neuron and one or more postsynaptic neurons.
It can involve:

- [Functional]{.highlight}
  - Changes in the `efficacy` of existing synaptic contacts
- [Structural]{.highlight}
  - `Formation` of new synaptic contacts  
    (structural plasticity)
  - `Elimination` of existing synaptic contacts  
    (structural plasticity)
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Adult Neurogenesis

Adult neurogenesis refers to the `generation of new neurons`  
that integrate into pre-existing neural circuits.

It occurs `only` in specific brain structures:

- `Hippocampus`  

- Olfactory bulb  

- `Not` in the cerebral cortex
:::

::: 
::: 

## The rules of Synaptic Plasticity

>Not all changes in electrical activity induce plasticity phenomena in a
neural circuit.

:::info-box
Hebb’s Principle

Hebb’s principle states that if a presynaptic neuron **A** repeatedly activates  
a postsynaptic neuron **B**, the synaptic connection between **A** and **B** is strengthened  
(1949).

A corollary of Hebb’s principle

If neuron **A** repeatedly fails to activate neuron **B**,  
the synaptic connection between **A** and **B** is weakened.

>Neurons that fire together, wire together.

:::

## Detecting correlated activity

:::card
A key molecular mechanism is the `NMDA receptor`.
It is a glutamate receptor with special properties.
It acts as a `coincidence detector`.
:::

:::info-box
[NMDA]{.highlight} receptors require `two conditions` to be met:

- Glutamate release from the `presynaptic` neuron  
- Depolarization of the `postsynaptic` membrane  

>At resting membrane potential the NMDA receptor channel is blocked by a magnesium ion.
Glutamate alone is not sufficient to activate it.

:::

## Detecting correlated activity

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
During normal synaptic activity:

- **AMPA receptors** open  
- Sodium enters the postsynaptic neuron  

This produces fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
:::

:::info-box
During correlated activity:

- Presynaptic glutamate release occurs  
- Postsynaptic depolarization is sufficient  

The magnesium block is removed and NMDA receptors now open.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/plast_nmda.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
Opening of NMDA receptors allows:

- **Calcium ions** to enter the postsynaptic neuron 

The most important `effect` is:

- Insertion of additional `AMPA receptors` into the postsynaptic membrane  

:::

::: 
::: 

## Long-term potentiation (LTP)

[Long-term potentiation (LTP)]{.highlight} is a persistent increase  
in synaptic efficacy following correlated activity.

>LTP is considered a cellular mechanism of learning and memory.


![](images/plast_LTP.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

## Effects of synaptic plasticity

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
One form of LTP is the [functional]{.highlight} modification of the synapse.

This involves:

- Increased synaptic efficacy  
- Insertion of additional AMPA receptors  
- Enhanced postsynaptic responsiveness  

This effect take place after few seconds after the triggering event.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
LTP can also involve [morphological]{.highlight} modification of the synapse.

This includes:

- Growth of dendritic spines  
- Enlargement of existing synapses  
- Formation of new synaptic contacts  

Structural changes `stabilize` long-term modifications and take place after hours or days respect to the triggering event.

## Synaptic weakening

::: columns
::: column

:::card
Hebbian plasticity has an important corollary.
If presynaptic activity repeatedly fails to activate  
the postsynaptic neuron, synapses can weaken.
:::

:::info-box
`Long-term depression (LTD)` is a persistent decrease in synaptic efficacy.

Functional LTD involves:

- Removal of AMPA receptors from the synapse  
- Reduced postsynaptic responsiveness  

Transmission becomes less effective.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
LTD can also produce morphological changes:

- Shrinkage of dendritic spines  
- Elimination of synaptic contacts  

This supports pruning and circuit refinement.
:::

:::info-box

LTP and LTD operate together. They allow neural circuits to:

- Strengthen relevant connections  
- Weaken irrelevant ones  

Plasticity is about balance, not only growth.

:::

## Synaptic weakening

![](images/plast_LTP_LTD.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

## The instability problem

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
If Hebbian plasticity acted alone:

- Highly active neurons would increase their firing indefinitely  
- Weakly active neurons would fall silent  

Neural activity would become unbalanced.

:::

:::info-box
This is incompatible with stable brain function.
Unregulated Hebbian plasticity would lead to:

- Runaway excitation in some circuits  
- Loss of activity in others  

Learning would destroy, rather than preserve, network function.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The nervous system requires mechanisms that:

- Stabilize overall activity  
- Prevent excessive excitation or depression  

This principle is called **homeostatic plasticity**.
:::

:::card
**Homeostatic plasticity** refers to mechanisms that maintain neural activity within a functional range.

It preserves the **overall level of discharge** of neurons and networks.

:::


::: 
::: 

## Homestatic plasticity

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box

Homeostatic plasticity acts to stabilize:

- Average firing rate  
- Synaptic input strength  
- Network excitability  


:::

:::info-box
When activity is chronically high:

- Synaptic strengths are globally scaled down  

When activity is chronically low:

- Synaptic strengths are globally scaled up  

`Relative differences` between synapses are preserved.
:::


::: 
::: column

:::info-box
A key contrast:

- **Hebbian plasticity**  
  Strengthens or weakens specific synapses  

- **Homeostatic plasticity**  
  Regulates overall activity levels  

Both operate simultaneously.

## Adult neurogenesis

::: columns
::: column

The richness of the environment affects neural plasticity  
not only at synapses, but also at the level of `cell generation`.

>This process is called `adult neurogenesis`.

:::info-box
Adult neurogenesis refers to the generation of `new neurons`  
that integrate into `pre-existing neural circuits`.

For a long time, this was believed to occur only during development.

Adult neurons were considered a `non-renewable population`.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The presence of adult neurogenesis was demonstrated  
by [Fernando Nottebohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Nottebohm) in the late 1980s.

This discovery challenged a long-standing dogma in neuroscience.

## Neurogenesis in adult birds and mammals

::: columns
::: column

In adult birds, neurogenesis occurs in:

- `Song nuclei`  
- `Hippocampus`  

These neurons were proposed to support:

- Seasonal `song learning`  
- `Memory for food` cache locations  

Adult neurogenesis is linked to `learning and memory`.

:::card
In the late 1990s, adult neurogenesis was also demonstrated  
in adult mammals, including `humans`.

However, it occurs only in `specific brain regions`.
:::

::: 
::: column

In adult mammals, neurogenesis occurs mainly in:

- The `dentate gyrus` of the hippocampus  

There is `no clear evidence` for neurogenesis in:

- Neocortical areas  

Adult neurogenesis is spatially restricted.

## Estimating neuron birth in humans

![](images/plast_neurogenesis_humans.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

By measuring radioactivity in post-mortem hippocampal tissue:

- About `700 new neurons per day` are generated  
- Most die by `apoptosis`  
- `Some integrate` into hippocampal circuits  

Approximately `1.75%` of dentate gyrus granule cells  
are renewed each year.

## What is hippocampal neurogenesis for?

::: columns
::: column

After decades of research:

- Evidence is abundant  
- Results are sometimes conflicting  
- `No` definitive `consensus` exists  

Several functional hypotheses have been proposed.

:::info-box
Hypothesis 1: `pattern separation`

Pattern separation allows similar experiences  
to be stored as `distinct memories`.

Pattern separation enables:

- Precise encoding of `spatial context`  
- Precise encoding of `temporal context`  
:::
- 
::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Hypothesis 2: memory consolidation

Proposes that neurogenesis supports  
`systems-level memory consolidation`.

Early after learning:

- The `hippocampus` is active  
- The `cortex` is relatively silent  

Weeks later:

- Cortical regions support memory retrieval  
- Hippocampal involvement decreases  

Memories are transferred.
:::

:::

## Neurogenesis and pattern separation

::: columns
::: column

Two events may partially overlap:

- Event 1: at my cousin’s house, during summer (A) 
- Event 2: at my aunt’s house, during fall (B)  

Good pattern separation allows these events  
to be stored as `separate memory traces`.

:::info-box
The `dentate gyrus` is thought to:

- Separate overlapping contextual representations  
- Encode temporal context  

Adult-born neurons may provide a `timestamp` for memories.

## Systems consolidation

::: columns
::: column
:::info-box
`Early` after learning:

- The `hippocampus` is active  
- The `cortex` is relatively silent  

Weeks `later`:

- Cortical regions support memory retrieval  
- Hippocampal involvement decreases  

Memories are `transferred`.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/plast_mem_migration.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
In animals manipulating neurogenesis shows that:

- Increasing neurogenesis accelerates consolidation
- Reducing neurogenesis delays consolidation  

:::

## Ways to increase neurogenesis

::: columns
::: column

[Environmental enrichment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_enrichment) and `physical exercise`:

- Enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity  
- Increase hippocampal neurogenesis  

These effects occur even in `older animals`.

:::info-box
In humans, aerobic exercise:

- Increases blood flow in the hippocampus  
- Especially in the `dentate gyrus`  

This increase correlates with `memory performance`.
