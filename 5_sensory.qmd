## Beyond the “Five Senses”

The idea that humans have only `five senses` is a historical simplification.

::: info-box
What we call a `sense` is any system that:

- `detects` a specific form of energy or chemical signal
- `converts` it into neural activity
- `provides` information about the body or the environment
:::

By this definition, the nervous system supports many `parallel` sensory channels, often operating outside awareness.

:::tip
**The brain does not experience “the world” directly.**  
It constructs reality from multiple specialized `input streams`, some obvious, some silent.
:::

## Additional Sensory Systems

Beyond `vision`, `audition`, `smell`, `taste`, and `touch`, the nervous system includes:

::: colummns
::: column

:::info-box
[Equilibrioception (vestibular sense)]{.highlight}  
Signals head position and movement, supporting `balance`, posture, and stable vision.

[Proprioception]{.highlight}    
Provides continuous information about `limb position`, muscle stretch, and joint angle, even with eyes closed.

[Interoception]{.highlight}    
Monitors the `internal state` of the body, including heart rate, respiration, hunger, visceral pain, and arousal.
:::

:::
::: column

:::info-box
[Nociception]{.highlight}  
Detection of `harmful stimuli`. It is `not` pain, which is a perceptual and emotional construct.

[Thermoception]{.highlight}   
Sensing `temperature` changes.

[Pruriception (Itch)]{.highlight}    
A distinct sensory modality, not just weak pain.

[Chemoception (internal)]{.highlight}   
Detection of `blood chemistry` such as CO₂.
:::

:::
:::

## What is a sensory system

::: columns
::: column
A sensory system allows the nervous system to `detect` and process `stimuli` from the environment.

>Each system is specialized for a particular form of energy or stimulus.

Despite their differences, sensory systems share common organizational principles.

:::info-box
[Sensory Transduction]{.highlight}

Sensory systems work by converting `physical stimuli` into `neural signals`.
This process is called **`transduction`**.

:::

::: 
::: column

>[Sensory receptors]{.highlight}: Sensory transduction begins at **[sensory receptors]{.highlight}**.

:::info-box

Different receptors are tuned to different stimulus types:

- `Photoreceptors` detect light  
- `Mechanoreceptors` detect touch and vibration  
- `Chemoreceptors` detect chemicals  
- `Nociceptors` detect damaging stimuli  
:::

:::
:::

## Sensory Neural Code
::: columns
::: column
Sensory transduction begins at [sensory receptors]{.highlight}.

::: info-box
[Receptor potentials]{.highlight}

Sensory receptors generate receptor potentials, graded changes in membrane potential. Stronger stimuli generally produce larger receptor potentials.
If threshold is reached, action potentials are generated.
:::

::: card

Stimulus intensity is `encoded` in two main ways:

- Firing rate of action potentials  
- Number of activated receptors
:::

:::
::: column

::: info-box

Receptive fields

A **receptive field** is the region of sensory space that influences a neuron.

Examples include:

- A patch of skin  
- A region of the retina  
- A specific sound frequency  

:::

![](images/sens_RF_touch.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Sensory pathways
::: columns
::: column
Most sensory systems follow a common pathway:

1. Peripheral receptor  
2. Entry into CNS  
3. Relay through the thalamus  
4. Projection to primary sensory cortex  

:::info-box
The [thalamus]{.highlight} plays a central role in sensory processing. It does more than `relay` information. 
It actively `modulates` and organizes sensory signals before they reach cortex.
:::

:::
::: column

> There is one **exception** the `olfaction`: The olfactory system does not relay through the thalamus, but the signal reaches cortex directly.

![](images/sen_sensory_pathways.png){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Primary sensory cortex

::: columns
::: column
Each sensory system has a **primary cortical area**.

::: info-box
These areas:

- Serve as the `entry point` for cortical processing  
- Receive `organized` sensory input  
- Preserve `spatial relationships`  
:::

> Damage here produces `modality-specific` deficits.

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_sensory_pathways.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Distributed processing
::: columns
::: column
Perception does not arise in a single area.

::: info-box
Sensory information is processed across:

1. Primary cortex  
2. Secondary areas  
3. Association cortices  
:::

>Perception is an `emergent property` of distributed networks.

:::
:::column
![](images/sen_association.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Vision

::: columns
::: column

::: info-box
The visual system responds to [electromagnetic radiation]{.highlight} in the visible spectrum.

Key `properties` of light include:

- `Wavelength`  
- `Intensity`  

These properties are transformed into neural signals by the `retina`.
:::

:::info-box

A 'sensory window' is the part of a physical dimension that a biological system can detect. 
What lies outside the window is not perceived, but it still exists.
**Human vision** : Sensitive roughly to wavelengths between `~400 nm (violet)` and `~700 nm (red)`
:::

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_spectrum.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
![](images/sen_sensory_win.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Anatomy of the eye

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Light enters the eye through several `structures`:

- [Cornea]{.highlight}  
- [Pupil]{.highlight}  
- [Lens]{.highlight}
- [Retina]{.highlight}  
:::

:::card
The [Retina]{.highlight} is organized in `layers`.
Light passes through several cell layers before reaching photoreceptors.
Neural processing begins within the retina itself.
:::

:::
:::column
![](images/sen_eye.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_retina.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Photoreceptors
::: columns
::: column
>Photoreceptors are specialized cells that respond to light.

:::info-box
There are two main types:

- [Rods]{.highlight}  
- [Cones]{.highlight}    
:::

::: card
`Rods` are highly sensitive to light. They are specialized for:

- `Low-light` conditions (Night vision - Scotopic)
- `No color` information

:::

::: 
::: column

::: card
`Cones` are less sensitive to light. They are specialized for:

- Daylight vision  
- Color perception  
- High spatial resolution  

Humans typically have `3 cone types`.

:::

![](images/sen_photoreceptors.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The fovea and the Optic Nerve

:::columns
::: column

:::card
The [fovea]{.highlight} is a small region near the center of the retina.
It contains a `high density of cones`. 
It provides the `highest visual acuity`.
:::

::: info-box
In addition to photoreceptors, the retina contains:

- `Bipolar` cells
- `Horizontal` cells  
- `Amacrine` cells  
- `Ganglion` cells  

These cells shape and refine visual signals.
:::


:::
:::column

::: card
The axons of ganglion cells form the [optic nerve]{.highlight}.

This nerve carries visual information to the brain.

Where the optic nerve exits the retina, there are no photoreceptors.
This creates the `blind spot`.
:::

![](images/sen_fovea.jpg){width="250" fig-align="left"}
![](images/sen_rgc.jpg){width="250" fig-align="right"}

:::
:::

## Retinal ganglion cells (RGC)

::: columns
::: column
>Retinal ganglion cells are the `output` neurons of the retina.
>They receive input indirectly from photoreceptors through bipolar and amacrine cells.
>Their axons form the `optic nerve`.

:::info-box
Retinal ganglion cell `receptive fields` are [circular]{.highlight} and organized into [2 regions]:

- A `central` region  
- A `surrounding` region  

Light affects these regions in `opposite` ways.
:::

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_rgc_rf.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_rgc_rf1.png){width="380" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## RGC Receptive Field

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
In [ON-center]{.highlight} ganglion cells:

- Light in the center increases firing  
- Light in the surround decreases firing  

>They respond best to a bright spot on a darker background.

![](images/sen_rgc_rf_on.jpg){width="150" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In [OFF-center]{.highlight} ganglion cells:

- Light in the center decreases firing  
- Light in the surround increases firing  

>They respond best to a dark spot on a brighter background.

![](images/sen_rgc_rf_off.jpg){width="150" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::
:::

## RGC Receptive Field 

::: card
Uniform illumination produces weak responses. his makes the RGC sensitive to `changes` in relative illumination across space-time.

:::

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Center–surround organization emphasizes:

- `Contrast`
- `Changes` in light intensity  
- No relation with the absolute light levels 
:::

:::
::: column

::: info-box
Center-surround receptive fields arise from `retinal circuitry`.

Key contributors include:

- Bipolar cells  
- Horizontal cells  
- Amacrine cells  

`Lateral interactions` are essential.
:::

:::
:::

## Visual acuity

:::columns
:::column
>[Visual acuity]{.highlight} refers to the ability to resolve fine spatial detail.

:::info-box
Visual acuity is constrained by multiple factors:

- Density of photoreceptors in the retina  
- Size of receptive fields  
- Cortical magnification in visual cortex  

Acuity is highest in the `fovea` and decreases toward the periphery.
:::
:::
:::column

>`Eye movements` continuously place objects of interest onto high-acuity regions (Fovea).

![](images/sen_vis_acuity.jpg){width="450" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## From retina to the Brain

:::columns
:::column

:::card
After retinal processing, visual information leaves the eye through the **optic nerve**. Each optic nerve carries information from `one eye`.
At this stage, information is `segregated` by eye. The optic nerves meet at the [optic chiasm]{.highlight}. Here, some axons cross to the opposite side of the brain.
This crossing is `partial`, not complete.
:::

:::info-box
The `Crossing Rule`:

- Axons from the [nasal]{.highlight} retina **cross** at the chiasm.

- Axons from the [temporal]{.highlight} retina remain on the **same side**.

Each hemisphere receives information from the [contralateral]{.highlight} visual field.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
**Ipsilateral**  
Located on the *same side* of the body as the structure or reference point.

**Contralateral**  
Located on the *opposite side* of the body relative to the structure or reference point.
:::

:::info-box
After the chiasm:

- Left hemisphere processes right visual field  
- Right hemisphere processes left visual field  

:::

:::
:::

## The thalamus

:::columns
:::column

:::card
Beyond the chiasm, axons continue as the `optic tract`.
Most optic tract fibers synapse in the `thalamus`. This relay is obligatory for `conscious vision`.
:::

:::info-box
Visual information synapses in the [lateral geniculate nucleus]{.highlight} (LGN).

The LGN:

- `Preserves` retinal organization  
- Maintains `separation` of inputs (monocular)  
- `Modulates` signal flow to cortex  
- Receptive fields are similar to those of RGC (circular)

:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_vis_field.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_talamus.jpg){width="250" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Input to V1

:::columns
:::column

>Axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus project to V1 (Primary Visual Cortex).
>These projections travel via the `optic radiations`.
> Arriving to the `IV layer` of V1.
> Each hemisphere represents the **contralateral visual field**.

:::info-box
V1 is organized [retinotopically]{.highlight}.

This means that:

- Neighboring points in the retina  
- Map to neighboring points in cortex  

`Spatial relationships` are preserved.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Cortical Magnification Factor]{.highlight}:Retinotopy is not uniform.

The fovea occupies a disproportionately large area of V1.

This reflects:

- High cone density  
- High visual acuity  

Central vision is overrepresented.

:::

![](images/sen_retinotopy.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What V1 neurons encode

:::columns
:::column

>Neurons in V1 respond to `simple visual features` and start integrating the `binocular` input.

:::info-box
Features encoded:

- `Edges`  
- `Orientation`  
- `Spatial location` 
- `Binocularity` from layer 2/3

V1 extracts structure from retinal input.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_vispath_v1.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_od_columns.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## V1 Receptive Fields

:::columns
:::column

>Neurons in primary visual cortex have receptive fields that differ from those in the retina.
> **They are not circular!**
> They are `elongated` and selective for specific visual features.

::: info-box
Each V1 neuron prefers a specific orientation.
Rotation of the stimulus away from the preferred orientation reduces the response.
:::

![](images/sen_v1_rf_shape.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Even-symmetric]{.highlight} receptive fields have:

- Symmetric ON and OFF regions  
- Strong responses to bars  

They respond best to a bright or dark `line` at the preferred orientation.
:::


:::info-box
[Odd-symmetric]{.highlight} receptive fields have:

- Asymmetric ON and OFF regions  
- Strong responses to edges  

They are particularly sensitive to `luminance transitions`.
:::

:::
:::

## V1 Receptive Fields 2

:::columns
:::column

::: info-box

[Simple cells]{.highlight} have:

- Clearly defined ON and OFF subregions  
- Strong orientation selectivity  
- Sensitivity to exact stimulus position and polarity

:::

::: info-box
[Complex cells]{.highlight} also show `orientation` selectivity.

- Lack clearly separated ON and OFF regions  
- Are less sensitive to exact position

They `integrate` input over space.

::: 

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_rf_simple_complex.png){width="450" fig-align="center"}


:::
:::

## A feedforward model of vision

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
In the `feedforward models`:

- Simple features are combined into complex ones
- Features become more abstract  
- Sensitivity to exact position decreases
:::

::: info-box
Feedforward models are [incomplete]{.highlight}.

They do not fully explain:

- `Contextual` effects  
- `Attention`  
- [Visual illusions](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i)  

Additional interactions are required.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_rf_video.mp4){width="450" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Higher-order visual cortex

:::card
Beyond V1, visual information diverges. Multiple cortical areas specialize in different aspects of vision.
These areas form distributed processing streams.
:::

:::info-box
Visual processing splits into two dominant pathways:

- `Ventral` stream  
- `Dorsal` stream  

They differ in anatomy, function, and behavioral relevance.
:::

## The “what” and "where" pathways

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The [ventral stream]{.highlight} runs from occipital to temporal cortex.

It is primarily involved in:

- `Object` recognition  
- `Shape` and `color` processing  
- `Face` perception  

>It answers the question: `What is it?`
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box

The [dorsal stream]{.highlight} runs from occipital to parietal cortex.

It is involved in:

- `Spatial` localization  
- `Motion` processing  
- Visually guided `actions`  

>It answers the question: `Where is it?`
:::

:::
:::

## Beyond what and where

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The two-stream model is a simplification.

Modern views emphasize:

- `Interaction` between streams  
- `Feedback` connections  
- Task-dependent processing  

Vision is dynamic, not strictly hierarchical.

:::

:::info-box
Higher-order areas send feedback to earlier visual cortex (`top-down` stream).

- Attention  
- Contextual effects
- Prediction
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_what_where.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The ventral stream and identity

:::columns
:::column

> Faces detection and recognition is a [Holistic process]{.highlight}. This means that faces  are processed as integrated wholes.

:::info-box
A key region for face perception is the [fusiform area]{.highlight} of the temporal lobe.

It is involved in:

- `Recognizing` individual faces  
- `Discriminating` subtle facial features 
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_faces_inversion.gif){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_faces_illusion.mp4){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Damage to the what pathway 

:::columns
:::column
>Damage to ventral visual cortex can spare basic vision.
>Patients may see objects clearly but fail to identify or discriminate objects.

:::info-box

[Prosopagnosia]{.highlight} is a selective impairment in face recognition.

Affected individuals:

- Can (or cannot, in severe cases) see faces  
- Cannot `recognize` faces 

Other visual abilities are often preserved.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Individuals with prosopagnosia often rely on:

- Voice  
- Clothing  
- Contextual cues  
:::

![](images/sen_oliver_sacks.jpg){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What prosopagnosia reveals

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Prosopagnosia demonstrates that:

- Face recognition is neurally specialized  
- Vision and recognition can dissociate  
- The higher order cortical areas can act as `expert systems` 

Seeing is not the same as knowing.
:::

:::info-box
An expert system is a neural network that:

- Is highly `selective`  
- Encodes complex, meaningful `patterns`  
- Responds `efficiently` to familiar categories  

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
We discriminate faces:

- Rapidly (100-400 ms)
- Automatically  
- With high precision

:::

:::info-box
The [grandmother neuron]{.highlight} hypothesis proposes that:

- A single neuron represents a specific, complex concept  
- For example, one neuron for your grandmother  

:::

:::
:::

## Problems with grandmother neurons

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A strict grandmother neuron model would be:

- Fragile to cell loss  
- Inflexible  
- Inefficient for representing many identities  

Most neuroscientists reject this literal interpretation.
:::



:::card
These neurons do not encode a single image. 
They respond to an **abstract identity**. 
They are better understood as:

- Highly selective nodes  
- Within a distributed representation  

Not isolated concept holders.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Higher-order cortex likely uses **sparse coding**.

This means:

- Few neurons respond strongly  
- Many neurons contribute weakly  
- Representations are distributed but efficient  

This balances specificity and robustness.
:::

:::
:::

## Spatial localization deficits

:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Damage to dorsal areas impairs:

- Impaired perception of movement  
- Difficulty tracking moving objects  

In extreme cases, motion appears fragmented or absent.
:::

:::info-box
[Akinetopsia]{.highlight}, or motion blindness, is a rare condition linked to dorsal stream damage.

Patients perceive the world as a sequence of static snapshots.

Motion information fails to integrate over time.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_akinetopsia.jpg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The somatosensory system

The sense of touch allows the nervous system to detect mechanical stimulation of the body. Touch is not a single sense.
It is a collection of specialized channels working together.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
It provides information about:

- Contact  
- Pressure  
- Vibration  
- Stretch  

Touch is essential for interaction with the environment.
:::


:::
:::column

![](images/sen_touch.jpg){width="100" fig-align="right"}

:::info-box
The somatosensory system includes multiple modalities:

- Light touch  
- Pressure and vibration  
- Skin stretch  
- Proprioception  
- Pain and temperature  

These modalities are detected by different receptor types.

:::

:::
:::

## Mechanoreceptors {#mechanoreceptors}

>Touch begins at [mechanoreceptors]{.highlight}.
These receptors convert mechanical forces into neural signals. Each type is tuned to specific stimulus properties.

:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Key mechanoreceptors in the skin include:

- **Meissner corpuscles**  
  Sensitive to motion and light touch  

- **Merkel cells**  
  Detect edges and fine detail  

- **Pacinian corpuscles**  
  Detect vibration  

- **Ruffini endings**  
  Detect skin stretch  
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_touch_term.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Spatial acuity

:::columns
:::column

:::card
Each mechanoreceptor has a **receptive field**.
This is the region of skin where stimulation affects that receptor.
Smaller receptive fields allow finer spatial resolution.
:::

:::info-box
Touch sensitivity is `not uniform` across the body.

Regions such as:

- Fingertips  
- Lips  

Have higher receptor density and smaller receptive fields.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Touch intensity is encoded by:

- Firing rate  
- Number of activated receptors  

:::

:::info-box
Somatosensory information travels from:

- Peripheral receptors  
- Through spinal nerves  
- Into the central nervous system  

This information is organized and preserved along the pathway.

:::

:::
:::

## Two major somatosensory pathways


:::columns
:::column

Somatosensory information reaches the brain through `two main pathways`.

They differ in:

- The type of information they carry  
- Their anatomical routes  
- Their functional roles

:::info-box
The **dorsal column pathway** carries:

- Fine touch  
- Vibration  
- Proprioception  

This pathway supports precise spatial and discriminative touch.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In the dorsal column pathway:

- Primary afferents enter the spinal cord  
- Ascend ipsilaterally in the dorsal columns  
- `Synapse in the medulla`  
- `Cross` to the contralateral side  
- Project to the thalamus  
:::

:::
:::

## Spinothalamic pathway

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The **spinothalamic pathway** carries:

- Pain  
- Temperature

It is specialized for detecting potentially harmful stimuli.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In the spinothalamic pathway:

- Primary afferents enter the spinal cord  
- `Synapse almost immediately`  
- Cross to the contralateral side near entry  
- Ascend to the thalamus  
:::

:::info-box
The two pathways differ in function:

- **Dorsal column**  
  Precise, fast, spatially accurate  

- **Spinothalamic**  
  Coarser, slower, protective

:::

:::
:::

## Somatosensory Pathways
![](images/sen_touch_pathways.png){width="700" fig-align="center"}

## Primary somatosensory cortex {#S1}

:::columns
:::column

>Somatosensory information reaches **primary somatosensory cortex** (S1).
S1 is located in the postcentral gyrus.
It contains an ordered map of the body (Somatotopy).

:::info-box
`Somatotopy` means that:

- Body position is mapped systematically  
- Neighboring body regions map to neighboring neural regions  
:::

:::
:::column
>The **sensory homunculus** is a distorted body map.
Body parts with high sensory acuity occupy more cortical space.
Hands, lips, and face are overrepresented.

:::
:::

## Cortical magnification and Lesions

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Cortical representation does not reflect body size.

It reflects:

- Receptor density  
- Behavioral relevance  

This parallels foveal magnification in vision.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Lesions in somatosensory cortex produce:

- Loss of sensation in specific body regions  
- Deficits that reflect the cortical map  

The pattern of loss reveals underlying organization.
:::

:::
:::

## Pain as a distinct system

>Pain is not simply strong touch.
It is a distinct sensory system specialized for detecting potential or actual tissue damage.
Its primary function is protection, not perception.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

Pain begins at specialized receptors called [nociceptors]{.highlight}.

These receptors respond to:

- Mechanical damage  
- Extreme temperatures  
- Chemical irritants  

They are activated only when stimuli exceed safe limits and activate the Spinothalamic pathway.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Nociception is detected by [Free Nerve Endings](#mechanoreceptors) and there are two main fiber types:

- **Aδ fibers**  
  Fast, sharp, well-localized pain  

- **C fibers**  
  Slow, dull, poorly localized pain  

These produce different pain sensations.
:::

:::
:::

## Central processing of pain

:::columns
:::column

Pain processing involves multiple brain regions.

These include:

- Thalamus  
- Amygdala
- Hyppocampus
- Somatosensory cortex  
- Insular cortex  
- Anterior cingulate cortex  
- Prefrontal Cortex

Pain has both sensory and emotional components.

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_touch_pain.jpg ){width="500" fig-align="left"}

:::
:::

## Pain is multidimensional

:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Pain includes:

- `Sensory`-discriminative aspects  
- `Affective`-motivational aspects  
- `Cognitive` modulation  
:::

:::card
[Phantom pain]{.highlight}
Pain can occur without peripheral input.
**Phantom pain** arises after limb loss.
This shows that pain is generated centrally, not only in the periphery.
:::

:::

Pain signals are not fixed.

They are `modulated` by:

- `Descending` cortical control  
- Brainstem circuits  
- `Context and expectation`  

Pain perception is `dynamic`.

## The auditory system

>Hearing allows the nervous system to detect and interpret sound.
Sound is a `pattern of pressure waves in air`from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Perception arises from how these waves are transformed into neural signals.

:::columns
:::column

![](images/sen_sound.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
Sound waves are characterized by:

- [Frequency]{.highlight} related to perceived `pitch`  
- [Amplitude]{.highlight} related to perceived `loudness`.

## Anatomy of the ear

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The auditory system converts:

- Air pressure changes  
- Into mechanical vibrations  
- Into electrical signals  

This transformation occurs in specialized structures of the ear.
:::

:::info-box
The ear is divided into 3 main parts:

- Outer ear  
- Middle ear  
- Inner ear  

Each part performs a specific transformation.
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
The `outer ear` collects sound waves. 
The `middle ear` amplifies vibrations using `3 small bones`. 
This amplification is essential for efficient sound transmission.
:::

:::info-box
The inner ear contains the [cochlea]{.highlight}.

Inside the cochlea:

- Sound vibrations create traveling waves  
- Different frequencies peak at different locations  

This spatial separation is fundamental to hearing.

## Hair cells

:::columns
:::column
>Sensory transduction occurs in the Coorti organ, where `Hair Cells` convert mechanical movement into electrical signals.
They are true `sensory receptors`.

:::info-box
Movement of hair bundles opens mechanically gated ion channels.

This leads to:

- Receptor potentials  
- Neurotransmitter release  
- Activation of auditory nerve fibers  

Sound is now encoded neurally.

## From ear to brain

:::info-box
Brainstem

>The first synapse occurs in the [cochlear nuclei]{.highlight} of the brainstem.
Information is split into parallel pathways.
Different aspects of sound are processed simultaneously.

>The [superior olivary complex]{.highlight} is a key site for sound localization.
It integrates input from both ears.
Different nuclei specialize in timing and intensity comparisons.
:::

:::info-box
From the brainstem, signals ascend through:

- Inferior colliculus  
- Medial Geniculate Nucleus (Thalamus)  

:::

## Interaural level differences

:::columns
:::column
>**Interaural level differences** arise from sound shadowing by the head.
They are most informative for high-frequency sounds.
These differences are computed in brainstem circuits.

:::info-box
The auditory system uses two main `interaural cues`:

- Interaural `time` differences (due to speed of sound)
- Interaural `amplitude` differences (due to the acoustic shadow)

Each cue is informative under different conditions.

## Primary auditory cortex


The **primary auditory cortex** is the first cortical stage of hearing.
It is located in the temporal lobe.
It receives organized input from the thalamus.

:::columns
:::column

>Primary auditory cortex is organized `tonotopically`:
Neighboring neurons respond to neighboring sound frequencies.

>`Cortical magnification`: Frequencies important for communication occupy more cortical space.
Representation reflects behavioral relevance, not physical frequency spacing.

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Damage to primary auditory cortex rarely causes deafness.

Instead, it impairs:

- Sound discrimination  
- Complex auditory perception  

Basic hearing often remains intact.
:::

:::
:::

## Beyond primary auditory cortex

>Primary auditory cortex encodes basic acoustic features.
However, hearing does not end in A1. Surrounding A1 are [secondary auditory areas]{.highlight}.
These regions receive input from A1 and from the thalamus. They integrate information over longer time windows.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Higher-order areas respond to:

- `Frequency` combinations  
- `Temporal` patterns  
- Sound `sequences`  

These features are essential for speech and music.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Higher-order auditory cortex supports [auditory objects]{.highlight}.
An auditory object is a coherent sound source over time.
Like:

- A voice  
- A melody  
- A moving sound  

The brain groups sound features into `perceptual units`.
