## Epigenetics and behavior

::: columns
::: column

Epigenetic mechanisms have attracted great interest in the study of `behavior` and `mental disorders`.

>They help explain how experiences, especially early in life,  
can have long-lasting effects on brain function.

:::info-box

Epigenetic mechanisms can explain:

- Why early `experiences` can have lifelong effects  
- Why  `stress` can also shape behavior  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms allow:

- Transient experiences  
- To produce long-term biological effects  

They provide a way for plasticity  
to be maintained over time.

## Epigenetic mechanisms

::: columns
::: column

There are several epigenetic mechanisms.
Two of the most studied are:

- `Histone acetylation`  
- `DNA methylation`  

:::info-box
Epigenetics was originally developed  
to explain how cellular traits are inherited  
without changes in DNA sequence.

This was crucial in:

- Developmental biology  
- Cell differentiation  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
During development we have undifferentiated cells ([stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell)):

- Cells are initially `totipotent`  
- Then become `multipotent`  
- Finally become `specialized`  

This occurs through epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
As cells encounter specific signals:

- Some genes are `silenced`  
- Others are `activated`  

The gene remains present, but epigenetic modulate its expression.

## Epigenetics in neurons

::: columns
::: column

In neurons:

- Epigenetic changes are maintained  
  at the level of the `individual cell`
- They provide long-term regulation of neuronal function.

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms are now considered crucial for:

- Long-term behavioral change  
- Resilience and vulnerability  
- Adaptive and maladaptive plasticity  

They link experience to lasting brain change.

:::


::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Epigenetic mechanisms are processes that:

- Alter `gene expression`  
- Without changing the `DNA sequence`  

They act through chromatin remodeling.
:::

::: 
:::

## Chromatin
::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Think of chromatin as a `spool of thread`:

- `Thread` = DNA  
- `Spool` = histone proteins  

DNA wraps around histones.
:::

:::info-box
`Chromatin` is the combination of:

- DNA  
- Histone proteins  

Its structure determines whether genes  
are accessible for transcription.
:::

::: 
::: column

## Chromatin states
::: columns
::: column

Chromatin can be:

| State        | [Transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `Inactive`   | Not accessible    |
| `Repressed`  | Low               |
| `Permissive` | Medium            |
| `Active`     | High              |

## DNA methylation

::: columns
::: column

`DNA methylation`:

- Adds a methyl group (`CH3`) to DNA  
- Acts as a transcriptional stop signal  

When methylation is present:

- Transcription machinery is blocked  

:::info-box
Life experiences can modify:

- Which regions of DNA are methylated  

This changes transcription probability  
without altering DNA sequence.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Studies of [monozygotic twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin) show:

- At early age, epigenetic patterns are similar  
- Later in life, patterns diverge  

Experience leaves an epigenetic signature.

## Histone modifications

::: columns
::: column

:::card
Histone proteins are not static.

They can undergo `post-translational modifications`  
after they are synthesized.

These modifications change how histones interact with DNA.
:::

:::info-box
A histone modification is a `chemical change` added to histone proteins.

These changes:

- Do not alter DNA sequence  
- Alter chromatin structure  
- Modify gene transcription probability  

They act as regulatory signals.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Histone modifications determine:

- How tightly DNA is packed  
- Whether a gene is accessible  

They regulate gene expression dynamically.
:::

:::card
`Histone acetylation` is one type of histone modification. It consists of adding an `acetyl group` to specific regions of histone proteins.

:::

:::info-box
Histone acetylation:

- Makes chromatin `less compact`  
- Increases DNA accessibility  

:::

::: 
::: 

## Histone modifications

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Common histone post-translational modifications include:

- `Acetylation`  
- `Methylation`  
- `Phosphorylation`  
- `Ubiquitination`  

Each modification can alter chromatin structure  
or recruit specific regulatory proteins. In a much more complex way.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Histone modifications do not act in isolation.

Different combinations of modifications  
create a `histone code`.

This code:

- Fine-tunes gene expression  
- Allows flexible and context-dependent regulation
