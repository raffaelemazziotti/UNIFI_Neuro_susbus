## What is a sensory system

::: columns
::: column
A sensory system allows the nervous system to `detect` and process `stimuli` from the environment.

>Each system is specialized for a particular form of energy or stimulus.

Despite their differences, sensory systems share common organizational principles.

:::info-box
[Sensory Transduction]{.highlight}

Sensory systems work by converting `physical stimuli` into `neural signals`.
This process is called **`transduction`**.

:::

::: 
::: column

>[Sensory receptors]{.highlight}: Sensory transduction begins at **[sensory receptors]{.highlight}**.

:::info-box

Different receptors are tuned to different stimulus types:

- `Photoreceptors` detect light  
- `Mechanoreceptors` detect touch and vibration  
- `Chemoreceptors` detect chemicals  
- `Nociceptors` detect damaging stimuli  
:::

## Sensory Neural Code
::: columns
::: column
Sensory transduction begins at [sensory receptors]{.highlight}.

::: info-box
[Receptor potentials]{.highlight}

Sensory receptors generate receptor potentials, graded changes in membrane potential. Stronger stimuli generally produce larger receptor potentials.
If threshold is reached, action potentials are generated.
:::

::: card

Stimulus intensity is `encoded` in two main ways:

- Firing rate of action potentials  
- Number of activated receptors
:::

::: column

::: info-box

Receptive fields

A **receptive field** is the region of sensory space that influences a neuron.

Examples include:

- A patch of skin  
- A region of the retina  
- A specific sound frequency

## Sensory pathways
::: columns
::: column
Most sensory systems follow a common pathway:

1. Peripheral receptor  
2. Entry into CNS  
3. Relay through the thalamus  
4. Projection to primary sensory cortex  

:::info-box
The [thalamus]{.highlight} plays a central role in sensory processing. It does more than `relay` information. 
It actively `modulates` and organizes sensory signals before they reach cortex.
:::

:::
::: column

> An **exception**: `olfaction` - The olfactory system does not relay through the thalamus, but the signal reaches cortex directly.

## Primary sensory cortex

Each sensory system has a **primary cortical area**.

These areas:

- Receive organized sensory input  
- Preserve spatial relationships  
- Serve as the entry point for cortical processing  

Damage here produces modality-specific deficits.
