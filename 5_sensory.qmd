## Beyond the “Five Senses”

The idea that humans have only `five senses` is a historical simplification.

::: info-box
What we call a `sense` is any system that:

- `detects` a specific form of energy or chemical signal
- `converts` it into neural activity
- `provides` information about the body or the environment
:::

By this definition, the nervous system supports many `parallel` sensory channels, often operating outside awareness.

:::tip
**The brain does not experience “the world” directly.**  
It constructs reality from multiple specialized `input streams`, some obvious, some silent.
:::

## Additional Sensory Systems

Beyond `vision`, `audition`, `smell`, `taste`, and `touch`, the nervous system includes:

::: colummns
::: column

:::info-box
[Equilibrioception (vestibular sense)]{.highlight}  
Signals head position and movement, supporting `balance`, posture, and stable vision.

[Proprioception]{.highlight}    
Provides continuous information about `limb position`, muscle stretch, and joint angle, even with eyes closed.

[Interoception]{.highlight}    
Monitors the `internal state` of the body, including heart rate, respiration, hunger, visceral pain, and arousal.
:::

:::
::: column

:::info-box
[Nociception]{.highlight}  
Detection of `harmful stimuli`. It is `not` pain, which is a perceptual and emotional construct.

[Thermoception]{.highlight}   
Sensing `temperature` changes.

[Pruriception (Itch)]{.highlight}    
A distinct sensory modality, not just weak pain.

[Chemoception (internal)]{.highlight}   
Detection of `blood chemistry` such as CO₂.
:::

:::
:::

## What is a sensory system

::: columns
::: column
A sensory system allows the nervous system to `detect` and process `stimuli` from the environment.

>Each system is specialized for a particular form of energy or stimulus.

Despite their differences, sensory systems share common organizational principles.

:::info-box
[Sensory Transduction]{.highlight}

Sensory systems work by converting `physical stimuli` into `neural signals`.
This process is called **`transduction`**.

:::

::: 
::: column

>[Sensory receptors]{.highlight}: Sensory transduction begins at **[sensory receptors]{.highlight}**.

:::info-box

Different receptors are tuned to different stimulus types:

- `Photoreceptors` detect light  
- `Mechanoreceptors` detect touch and vibration  
- `Chemoreceptors` detect chemicals  
- `Nociceptors` detect damaging stimuli  
:::

:::
:::

## Sensory Neural Code
::: columns
::: column
Sensory transduction begins at [sensory receptors]{.highlight}.

::: info-box
[Receptor potentials]{.highlight}

Sensory receptors generate receptor potentials, graded changes in membrane potential. Stronger stimuli generally produce larger receptor potentials.
If threshold is reached, action potentials are generated.
:::

::: card

Stimulus intensity is `encoded` in two main ways:

- Firing rate of action potentials  
- Number of activated receptors
:::

:::
::: column

::: info-box

Receptive fields

A **receptive field** is the region of sensory space that influences a neuron.

Examples include:

- A patch of skin  
- A region of the retina  
- A specific sound frequency  

:::

![](images/sens_RF_touch.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Sensory pathways
::: columns
::: column
Most sensory systems follow a common pathway:

1. Peripheral receptor  
2. Entry into CNS  
3. Relay through the thalamus  
4. Projection to primary sensory cortex  

:::info-box
The [thalamus]{.highlight} plays a central role in sensory processing. It does more than `relay` information. 
It actively `modulates` and organizes sensory signals before they reach cortex.
:::

:::
::: column

> There is one **exception** the `olfaction`: The olfactory system does not relay through the thalamus, but the signal reaches cortex directly.

![](images/sen_sensory_pathways.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Primary sensory cortex

::: columns
::: column
Each sensory system has a **primary cortical area**.

::: info-box
These areas:

- Serve as the `entry point` for cortical processing  
- Receive `organized` sensory input  
- Preserve `spatial relationships`  
:::

> Damage here produces `modality-specific` deficits.

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_sensory_pathways.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Distributed processing
::: columns
::: column
Perception does not arise in a single area.

::: info-box
Sensory information is processed across:

1. Primary cortex  
2. Secondary areas  
3. Association cortices  
:::

>Perception is an `emergent property` of distributed networks.

:::
:::column
![](images/sen_association.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Vision

::: columns
::: column

::: info-box
The visual system responds to [electromagnetic radiation]{.highlight} in the visible spectrum.

Key `properties` of light include:

- `Wavelength`  
- `Intensity`  

These properties are transformed into neural signals by the `retina`.
:::

:::info-box

A 'sensory window' is the part of a physical dimension that a biological system can detect. 
What lies outside the window is not perceived, but it still exists.
**Human vision** : Sensitive roughly to wavelengths between `~400 nm (violet)` and `~700 nm (red)`
:::

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_spectrum.jpg){width="500" fig-align="right"}
![](images/sen_sensory_win.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Anatomy of the eye

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Light enters the eye through several `structures`:

- [Cornea]{.highlight}  
- [Pupil]{.highlight}  
- [Lens]{.highlight}
- [Retina]{.highlight}  
:::

:::card
The [Retina]{.highlight} is organized in `layers`.
Light passes through several cell layers before reaching photoreceptors.
Neural processing begins within the retina itself.
:::

:::
:::column
![](images/sen_eye.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_retina.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Photoreceptors
::: columns
::: column
>Photoreceptors are specialized cells that respond to light.

:::info-box
There are two main types:

- [Rods]{.highlight}  
- [Cones]{.highlight}    
:::

::: card
`Rods` are highly sensitive to light. They are specialized for:

- `Low-light` conditions (Night vision - Scotopic)
- `No color` information

:::

::: 
::: column

::: card
`Cones` are less sensitive to light. They are specialized for:

- Daylight vision  
- Color perception  
- High spatial resolution  

Humans typically have `3 cone types`.

:::

![](images/sen_photoreceptors.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The fovea and the Optic Nerve

:::columns
::: column

:::card
The [fovea]{.highlight} is a small region near the center of the retina.
It contains a `high density of cones`. 
It provides the `highest visual acuity`.
:::

::: info-box
In addition to photoreceptors, the retina contains:

- `Bipolar` cells
- `Horizontal` cells  
- `Amacrine` cells  
- `Ganglion` cells  

These cells shape and refine visual signals.
:::


:::
:::column

::: card
The axons of ganglion cells form the [optic nerve]{.highlight}.

This nerve carries visual information to the brain.

Where the optic nerve exits the retina, there are no photoreceptors.
This creates the `blind spot`.
:::

![](images/sen_fovea.jpg){width="250" fig-align="left"}
![](images/sen_rgc.jpg){width="250" fig-align="right"}

:::
:::

## Retinal ganglion cells (RGC)

::: columns
::: column
>Retinal ganglion cells are the `output` neurons of the retina.
>They receive input indirectly from photoreceptors through bipolar and amacrine cells.
>Their axons form the `optic nerve`.

:::info-box
Retinal ganglion cell `receptive fields` are [circular]{.highlight} and organized into [2 regions]:

- A `central` region  
- A `surrounding` region  

Light affects these regions in `opposite` ways.
:::

:::
::: column

![](images/sen_rgc_rf.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_rgc_rf1.png){width="380" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## RGC Receptive Field

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
In [ON-center]{.highlight} ganglion cells:

- Light in the center increases firing  
- Light in the surround decreases firing  

>They respond best to a bright spot on a darker background.

![](images/sen_rgc_rf_on.jpg){width="150" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In [OFF-center]{.highlight} ganglion cells:

- Light in the center decreases firing  
- Light in the surround increases firing  

>They respond best to a dark spot on a brighter background.

![](images/sen_rgc_rf_off.jpg){width="150" fig-align="center"}

:::

:::
:::

## RGC Receptive Field 

::: card
Uniform illumination produces weak responses. his makes the RGC sensitive to `changes` in relative illumination across space-time.

:::

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Center–surround organization emphasizes:

- `Contrast`
- `Changes` in light intensity  
- No relation with the absolute light levels 
:::

:::
::: column

::: info-box
Center-surround receptive fields arise from `retinal circuitry`.

Key contributors include:

- Bipolar cells  
- Horizontal cells  
- Amacrine cells  

`Lateral interactions` are essential.
:::

:::
:::

## From retina to the Brain

:::columns
:::column

:::card
After retinal processing, visual information leaves the eye through the **optic nerve**. Each optic nerve carries information from `one eye`.
At this stage, information is `segregated` by eye. The optic nerves meet at the [optic chiasm]{.highlight}. Here, some axons cross to the opposite side of the brain.
This crossing is `partial`, not complete.
:::

:::info-box
The `Crossing Rule`:

- Axons from the [nasal]{.highlight} retina **cross** at the chiasm.

- Axons from the [temporal]{.highlight} retina remain on the **same side**.

Each hemisphere receives information from the [contralateral]{.highlight} visual field.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
**Ipsilateral**  
Located on the *same side* of the body as the structure or reference point.

**Contralateral**  
Located on the *opposite side* of the body relative to the structure or reference point.
:::

:::info-box
After the chiasm:

- Left hemisphere processes right visual field  
- Right hemisphere processes left visual field  

:::

:::
:::

## The thalamus

:::columns
:::column

:::card
Beyond the chiasm, axons continue as the `optic tract`.
Most optic tract fibers synapse in the `thalamus`. This relay is obligatory for `conscious vision`.
:::

:::info-box
Visual information synapses in the [lateral geniculate nucleus]{.highlight} (LGN).

The LGN:

- `Preserves` retinal organization  
- Maintains `separation` of inputs (monocular)  
- `Modulates` signal flow to cortex  
- Receptive fields are similar to those of RGC (circular)

:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_vis_field.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_talamus.jpg){width="250" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Input to V1

:::columns
:::column

>Axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus project to V1 (Primary Visual Cortex).
>These projections travel via the `optic radiations`.
> Arriving to the `IV layer` of V1.
> Each hemisphere represents the **contralateral visual field**.

:::info-box
V1 is organized [retinotopically]{.highlight}.

This means that:

- Neighboring points in the retina  
- Map to neighboring points in cortex  

`Spatial relationships` are preserved.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Cortical Magnification Factor]{.highlight}:Retinotopy is not uniform.

The fovea occupies a disproportionately large area of V1.

This reflects:

- High cone density  
- High visual acuity  

Central vision is overrepresented.

:::

![](images/sen_retinotopy.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What V1 neurons encode

:::columns
:::column

>Neurons in V1 respond to `simple visual features` and start integrating the `binocular` input.

:::info-box
Features encoded:

- `Edges`  
- `Orientation`  
- `Spatial location` 
- `Binocularity` from layer 2/3

V1 extracts structure from retinal input.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_vispath_v1.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_od_columns.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## V1 Receptive Fields

:::columns
:::column

>Neurons in primary visual cortex have receptive fields that differ from those in the retina.
> **They are not circular!**
> They are `elongated` and selective for specific visual features.

::: info-box
Each V1 neuron prefers a specific orientation.
Rotation of the stimulus away from the preferred orientation reduces the response.
:::

![](images/sen_v1_rf_shape.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Even-symmetric]{.highlight} receptive fields have:

- Symmetric ON and OFF regions  
- Strong responses to bars  

They respond best to a bright or dark `line` at the preferred orientation.
:::


:::info-box
[Odd-symmetric]{.highlight} receptive fields have:

- Asymmetric ON and OFF regions  
- Strong responses to edges  

They are particularly sensitive to `luminance transitions`.
:::

:::
:::

## V1 Receptive Fields 2

:::columns
:::column

::: info-box

[Simple cells]{.highlight} have:

- Clearly defined ON and OFF subregions  
- Strong orientation selectivity  
- Sensitivity to exact stimulus position and polarity

:::

::: info-box
[Complex cells]{.highlight} also show `orientation` selectivity.

- Lack clearly separated ON and OFF regions  
- Are less sensitive to exact position

They `integrate` input over space.

::: 

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_rf_simple_complex.png){width="450" fig-align="center"}


:::
:::

## A feedforward model of vision

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
In the `feedforward models`:

- Simple features are combined into complex ones
- Features become more abstract  
- Sensitivity to exact position decreases
:::

::: info-box
Feedforward models are [incomplete]{.highlight}.

They do not fully explain:

- `Contextual` effects  
- `Attention`  
- [Visual illusions](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i)  

Additional interactions are required.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_rf_video.mp4){width="450" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Higher-order visual cortex

:::card
Beyond V1, visual information diverges. Multiple cortical areas specialize in different aspects of vision.
These areas form distributed processing streams.
:::

:::info-box
Visual processing splits into two dominant pathways:

- `Ventral` stream  
- `Dorsal` stream  

They differ in anatomy, function, and behavioral relevance.
:::

## The “what” and "where" pathways

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The [ventral stream]{.highlight} runs from occipital to temporal cortex.

It is primarily involved in:

- `Object` recognition  
- `Shape` and `color` processing  
- `Face` perception  

>It answers the question: `What is it?`
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box

The [dorsal stream]{.highlight} runs from occipital to parietal cortex.

It is involved in:

- `Spatial` localization  
- `Motion` processing  
- Visually guided `actions`  

>It answers the question: `Where is it?`
:::

:::
:::

## Beyond what and where

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The two-stream model is a simplification.

Modern views emphasize:

- `Interaction` between streams  
- `Feedback` connections  
- Task-dependent processing  

Vision is dynamic, not strictly hierarchical.

:::

:::info-box
Higher-order areas send feedback to earlier visual cortex (`top-down` stream).

- Attention  
- Contextual effects
- Prediction
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_what_where.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The ventral stream and identity

:::columns
:::column

> Faces detection and recognition is a [Holistic process]{.highlight}. This means that faces  are processed as integrated wholes.

:::info-box
A key region for face perception is the [fusiform area]{.highlight} of the temporal lobe.

It is involved in:

- `Recognizing` individual faces  
- `Discriminating` subtle facial features 
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_faces_inversion.gif){width="400" fig-align="center"}
![](images/sen_faces_illusion.mp4){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Damage to the what pathway 

:::columns
:::column
>Damage to ventral visual cortex can spare basic vision.
>Patients may see objects clearly but fail to identify or discriminate objects.

:::info-box

[Prosopagnosia]{.highlight} is a selective impairment in face recognition.

Affected individuals:

- Can (or cannot, in severe cases) see faces  
- Cannot `recognize` faces 

Other visual abilities are often preserved.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Individuals with prosopagnosia often rely on:

- Voice  
- Clothing  
- Contextual cues  
:::

![](images/sen_oliver_sacks.jpg){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What prosopagnosia reveals

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Prosopagnosia demonstrates that:

- Face recognition is neurally specialized  
- Vision and recognition can dissociate  
- The higher order cortical areas can act as `expert systems` 

Seeing is not the same as knowing.
:::

:::info-box
An expert system is a neural network that:

- Is highly `selective`  
- Encodes complex, meaningful `patterns`  
- Responds `efficiently` to familiar categories  

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
We discriminate faces:

- Rapidly (100-400 ms)
- Automatically  
- With high precision

:::

:::info-box
The [grandmother neuron]{.highlight} hypothesis proposes that:

- A single neuron represents a specific, complex concept  
- For example, one neuron for your grandmother  

:::

:::
:::

## Problems with grandmother neurons

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A strict grandmother neuron model would be:

- Fragile to cell loss  
- Inflexible  
- Inefficient for representing many identities  

Most neuroscientists reject this literal interpretation.
:::



:::card
These neurons do not encode a single image. 
They respond to an **abstract identity**. 
They are better understood as:

- Highly selective nodes  
- Within a distributed representation  

Not isolated concept holders.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Higher-order cortex likely uses **sparse coding**.

This means:

- Few neurons respond strongly  
- Many neurons contribute weakly  
- Representations are distributed but efficient  

This balances specificity and robustness.
:::

:::
:::

## Spatial localization deficits

:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Damage to dorsal areas impairs:

- Impaired perception of movement  
- Difficulty tracking moving objects  

In extreme cases, motion appears fragmented or absent.
:::

:::info-box
[Akinetopsia]{.highlight}, or motion blindness, is a rare condition linked to dorsal stream damage.

Patients perceive the world as a sequence of static snapshots.

Motion information fails to integrate over time.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/sen_akinetopsia.jpg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The somatosensory system

The sense of touch allows the nervous system to detect mechanical stimulation of the body.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
It provides information about:

- Contact  
- Pressure  
- Vibration  
- Stretch  

Touch is essential for interaction with the environment.
