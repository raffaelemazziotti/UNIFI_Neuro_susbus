## What is Neuroplasticity

::: columns
::: column

The ability of the brain, of nervous circuits, to change in response to
experience is called `neuroplasticity`.

:::info-box
>The [effectiveness]{.highlight} of synaptic connections is changed by `experience`.

Experience changes the circuit’s electrical activity and this modifies the synaptic
effectiveness.

## The complexity of the brain

::: columns
::: column

>100 billion neurons

>Up to 1000 synaptic inputs on a single neuron

>600 million connections/mm3

:::card
Our behavior, thoughts, actions, perception, ability to imagine or remember,
depend on the coordinated activation of multiple nervous circuits, which may
also include neurons located in different brain areas.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
`Genetics` and individual `experience`:

1) `Interact` and together guide the `development` of behavior and
of neural circuits supporting it
2) continue to interact `throughout life`, by guiding the plastic
changes induced by experience in the brain and therefore in
behavior, by shaping the way we "see" what surrounds us and the
way we react to it.

> Different experiences, different brains, different behaviors

## Neurodevelopment

![](images/plast_brain_prebirth.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

How long does neurodevelopment take?

>It doesn’t take 9 months.
At birth, the human brain is still
very immature.

::: columns
::: column

`29 days`: there is a tube (neural
tube)

`59 days`: has acquired a different
morphology in the most anterior
part (where the brain will appear)

::: 
::: column

`70 days`: the brain can be already
recognized

`6 months`: there are no
convolutions yet, there is not yet
enough surface to fold it, it is
smooth

`9 months`: it is still very immature.

## Neurodevelopment

![](images/plast_brain_dev.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
::: columns
::: column

- `Neurulation` - Neural tube induction of the NS
- `Neurogenesis` - generation of neurons
- `Synaptogenesis` - formation of Synapses

::: 
::: column

- `Apoptosis` – programmed cell death
- `Gliogenesis` - generation of glia
- `Myelination` - the axons are covered by myelin

::: 
::: 

:::

## Neurodevelopment

:::info-box
`Gene specification` has the role of guiding the `initial` processes of brain
development and formation of neural connections.
:::

:::info-box
The `specific experience` of the individual and his interactions with the
environment have the role of guiding the `final phases` of the development of
the brain circuits, leading them to the mature state and therefore guiding the
development of the different expressions of behavior in an individual-specific
way.

[Synaptic Plasticity]{.higlight}

Synaptic plasticity refers to changes in the effectiveness of communication  
between a presynaptic neuron and one or more postsynaptic neurons.
It can involve:

- [Functional]{.highlight}
  - Changes in the `efficacy` of existing synaptic contacts
- [Structural]{.highlight}
  - `Formation` of new synaptic contacts  
    (structural plasticity)
  - `Elimination` of existing synaptic contacts  
    (structural plasticity)
:::

::: column

:::info-box
Adult Neurogenesis

Adult neurogenesis refers to the `generation of new neurons`  
that integrate into pre-existing neural circuits.

It occurs `only` in specific brain structures:

- `Hippocampus`  

- Olfactory bulb  

- `Not` in the cerebral cortex
:::

## The rules of Synaptic Plasticity

>Not all changes in electrical activity induce plasticity phenomena in a
neural circuit.

:::info-box
Hebb’s Principle

Hebb’s principle states that if a presynaptic neuron **A** repeatedly activates  
a postsynaptic neuron **B**, the synaptic connection between **A** and **B** is strengthened  
(1949).

A corollary of Hebb’s principle

If neuron **A** repeatedly fails to activate neuron **B**,  
the synaptic connection between **A** and **B** is weakened.

>Neurons that fire together, wire together.

## Detecting correlated activity

:::card
A key molecular mechanism is the `NMDA receptor`.
It is a glutamate receptor with special properties.
It acts as a `coincidence detector`.
:::

:::info-box
[NMDA]{.highlight} receptors require `two conditions` to be met:

- Glutamate release from the `presynaptic` neuron  
- Depolarization of the `postsynaptic` membrane  

>At resting membrane potential the NMDA receptor channel is blocked by a magnesium ion.
Glutamate alone is not sufficient to activate it.

:::

## Baseline synaptic transmission

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
During normal synaptic activity:

- **AMPA receptors** open  
- Sodium enters the postsynaptic neuron  

This produces fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
:::

:::info-box
During correlated activity:

- Presynaptic glutamate release occurs  
- Postsynaptic depolarization is sufficient  

The magnesium block is removed and NMDA receptors now open.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/plast_nmda.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
Opening of NMDA receptors allows:

- **Calcium ions** to enter the postsynaptic neuron 

The most important `effect` is:

- Insertion of additional `AMPA receptors` into the postsynaptic membrane

## Long-term potentiation (LTP)

[Long-term potentiation (LTP)]{.highlight} is a persistent increase  
in synaptic efficacy following correlated activity.

>LTP is considered a cellular mechanism of learning and memory.
