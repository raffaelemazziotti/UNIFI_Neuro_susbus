## A core problem

:::columns
:::column
At any moment, the brain faces multiple possibilities.
It must decide:

- What is important  
- What can be ignored  
- What requires action  

>Emotion and motivation solve this problem.

:::
:::column

![](images/emot_priorities.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
Emotion and motivation are tightly linked.
Both contribute to:

- `Prioritizing` information  
- `Biasing` decisions  
- `Driving` behavior  

:::


:::
:::

## A functional definition of emotion

Emotion can be defined as:

A `coordinated` brain-body `state` that `assigns value` to a situation and prepares action.
The terms `emotion` and `feeling` are often used interchangeably.
In neuroscience, they refer to related but distinct processes.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

[Emotions]{.highlight} are objective physiological and neural states.

- Brain `circuits`  
- Bodily `responses`  
- Action tendencies  
- Occur without conscious awareness
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Feelings]{.highlight} are the subjective experience of emotional states.
They reflect:

- Awareness of bodily changes  
- Cognitive `interpretation`  
- Context and memory  
- Require `consciousness`

:::


:::
:::

## A functional definition of emotion

:::columns
:::column

`Emotional` responses are generated `subcortically`.

`Feelings` depend more strongly on `cortical processing`.

`Emotions typically occur first`.
Feelings emerge later, if at all.

:::
:::column

:::info-box

You can have:

- Emotions without feelings  
- But not feelings without emotions  
:::

:::
:::

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
This distinction explains why:

- We can react before we know why  
- Emotional behavior can precede awareness  
- Regulation can target feelings but not initial emotional responses  

The brain acts before the mind explains.

## Brain networks for emotion and feeling

::: columns
::: column

There is no single “emotion center”.

:::info-box
Several brain regions are consistently involved in emotion-related processes:

- `Amygdala`  
- `Hypothalamus`  
- `Brainstem nuclei`  
- `Insular cortex`
- `Prefrontal cortex`  

Each contributes a specific computation.

## Brain networks for emotion and feeling

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
[Subcortical regions]{.highlight} contribute to `rapid` and `automatic` responses.

They are involved in:

- `Detecting` relevance  
- Generating `physiological changes`  
- Initiating `action` tendencies  

These processes can occur `without awareness`.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
[Cortical regions]{.highlight} contribute to:

- `Interpretation` of emotional states  
- `Contextual` modulation  
- Regulation and `control`  
- `Subjective` experience  

They shape how emotions are experienced as feelings.
:::

::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the amygdala

::: columns
::: column

The [amygdala](4_NS_organization.html#amygdala) is a key structure in emotional processing (generally `fear`).
It is located in the `medial temporal lobe`.
It is involved in detecting biologically relevant stimuli.

:::info-box
The amygdala contributes to:

- Rapid `evaluation` of relevance  
- `Detection` of potential threat  
- `Assigning` emotional significance  

It responds to both positive and negative stimuli.
Amygdala responses are fast.
They can occur before detailed cortical analysis.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Through its connections, the amygdala can:

- Influence `autonomic` responses  
- Bias `attention` toward relevant stimuli  
- Modulate `memory` formation
:::

![](images/emot_amygdala.jpeg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the amygdala

::: columns
::: column
The amygdala is required for `acquiring fear memories`  a process called `fear conditioning`.

>Fear conditioning is a form of `associative learning`: It allows the organism to learn that a neutral stimulus predicts danger.

:::info-box
In a typical fear conditioning experiment:

- A `neutral` stimulus is presented  
- An `aversive` stimulus follows  

After `repeated pairings`, the neutral stimulus alone elicits a fear response.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The amygdala integrates:

- `Sensory` information about the neutral stimulus  
- Information about the `aversive` outcome
:::

:::info-box
A key distinction:

- The amygdala is required for `acquiring` fear memories  
- It is also required for `expressing` conditioned fear  

Damage to the amygdala disrupts both.
:::

::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the amygdala

::: columns
::: column
:::info-box
Fear conditioning can occur in two main forms:

- `Cued fear conditioning`  
- `Contextual fear conditioning`  
:::

:::info-box
Fear conditioning relies on the [association]{.highlight} between:

- `Conditioned Stimulus (CS)`  
  A previously neutral stimulus, such as a tone, a light or the context  

- `Unconditioned Stimulus (US)`  
  An inherently aversive stimulus, such as a mild foot shock  
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Cued fear conditioning `procedure`:

Training phase

1. The animal is placed in a familiar chamber  
2. A CS (e.g. tone) is presented  
3. The CS is paired with a US

During the test phase

- The tone is presented alone  
- Often in a 'different context'

>If learning occurred, the CS alone elicits fear responses.

## A closer look: the Prefrontal Cortex

::: columns
::: column

Emotional responses are not fixed.
They can be shaped, modulated, and regulated.
A key role in this process is played by the [prefrontal cortex]{.highlight}.

:::info-box
Emotion regulation refers to processes that:

- `Modify` emotional responses  
- `Adjust` their intensity or duration  
- `Align` emotions with goals and context  

Regulation does not mean suppression.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_prefrontal.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the Prefrontal Cortex


::: columns
::: column
Different prefrontal subregions contribute differently:

- `Ventrolateral` prefrontal cortex  
  Value, emotional meaning, safety  

- `Dorsolateral` prefrontal cortex  
  Cognitive control and reappraisal  

- `Orbitofrontal` cortex  
  Outcome evaluation and updating  

:::info-box
One key regulatory strategy is [reappraisal](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6188704/).
Reappraisal involves:

- Changing how a situation is interpreted  
- Altering emotional impact  

This strategy strongly recruits prefrontal regions.

:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_prefrontal_subregions.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box

Prefrontal cortex regulates emotion through `top-down control`.

It can influence:

- Amygdala activity  
- Autonomic responses  
- Behavioral expression  

:::


::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the Prefrontal Cortex
The prefrontal cortex `matures` slowly.
Its structural and functional development continues [beyond 20 years of age]{.highlight}.
This maturation timeline has important behavioral consequences.

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
During `adolescence`:

- Subcortical emotion-related systems are largely matured  
- Emotional reactivity is strong  
- Prefrontal regulatory systems are still developing  

Emotion generation is functional, regulation is not yet fully mature.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_rebel.png){width="300" fig-align="center"}

:::info-box
This creates a `temporary imbalance`:

- `Strong` emotional and motivational signals  
- `Weaker` top-down regulatory control  

This imbalance contributes to increased emotional intensity and `risk-taking`.
:::

::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the Prefrontal Cortex

::: columns
::: column

>Fear learning is not permanent and inflexible.
Fear responses can be reduced when the threat is no longer present.
This process is called `fear extinction`.

:::info-box
During extinction:

- The conditioned stimulus (CS) is presented repeatedly  
- The unconditioned stimulus (US) is omitted

Over time, fear responses decrease.
Extinction is a `new form of learning`.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box

Extinction does **not** erase the original fear memory.
The CS-US association remains stored.
Fear expression is `modulated`, not deleted.

Fear responses can `reappear`:

- After time has passed  
- In a different context  
- After stress  

This shows that the original memory persists.

:::


::: 
::: 

## A closer look: the Prefrontal Cortex

::: columns
::: column
During extinction:

- Prefrontal cortex activity increases  
- Amygdala-driven fear responses decrease  

This reflects `top-down` inhibitory control.
In rodents, extinction depends strongly on the `infralimbic cortex`.
The infralimbic cortex is considered homologous to ventromedial prefrontal regions in humans.

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_fear_prefrontal.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## A functional definition of motivation

::: columns
::: column

Motivation is the `inner drive` that initiates, guides, and sustains goal-directed behavior
Motivation refers to processes that:

- Direct action toward goals  
- Sustain effort over time  

Motivation answers the question:

*Why act at all?*

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Emotion and motivation `interact`

Together, they determine:

- What is pursued  
- What is avoided  
- How strongly we act  

>Emotional value influences motivation.
Motivational state shapes emotional responses.

:::

:::
:::

## Neural systems for motivation

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
A key distinction:

- `Wanting`: Drive to obtain an outcome  

- `Liking`: Pleasure experienced from the outcome  

These processes can be dissociated.
:::

:::info-box
Motivation depends on `interactions` between:

- `Cortical` decision and control regions (Wanting)
- `Subcortical` reward-related systems (Liking)

These systems bias action selection.

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
`Dopamine` plays a central role in motivation.

It is involved in:

- Learning from outcomes  
- Predicting future rewards  

>Dopamine signals are not simple pleasure signals.

Two major dopaminergic pathways:

- `Mesolimbic` pathway: Involved in reward prediction and reinforcement  

- `Mesocortical` pathway: Involved in decision-making, cognitive control, and goal maintenance

## Neural systems for motivation

![](images/emot_motiv_circuits.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

## Reward prediction

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Motivational signals influence:

- Basal nuclei and motor planning areas  
- Decision-making circuits  

They `bias` which actions are selected and executed.
:::

:::info-box
Dopamine neurons respond to:

- Unexpected rewards  
- Cues that predict rewards  

Over learning, activity `shifts` from outcome to predictor.

This supports adaptive behavior.
:::

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_motiv_dopamine.jpg){width="450" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Reward prediction error

::: columns
::: column

:::tip

Dopamine neurons do not simply respond to rewards.
They signal whether outcomes are `better or worse than expected`.
This signal is called a [reward prediction error]{.highlight}.
:::

:::info-box
A reward prediction error reflects the difference between:

- Expected outcome  
- Actual outcome  

This signal is used to update future behavior.
Prediction error signals:

- `Update` value representations
- `Bias` future choices  

:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
Dopamine activity reflects prediction error:

- Reward is `better` than expected: dopamine activity [increases]{.highlight}  

- Reward is `as` expected: little or [no change]{.highlight}   

- Reward is `worse` than expected or omitted: dopamine activity [decreases]{.highlight}   

Learning occurs when expectations are `violated`.
Over learning:

- Dopamine responses shift from reward to predictive cues  
- The brain learns what predicts valuable outcomes  

This supports adaptive, `flexible` behavior.

## What is stress

::: columns
::: column

:::tip
Stress is not an emotion.
Stress is a `physiological response` to challenge or threat.
It prepares the organism to cope with demands.
:::

:::info-box
Stress refers to `coordinated brain and body responses` that:

- Mobilize energy  
- Increase vigilance  
- Promote adaptive action  

Stress is `adaptive` by design.
:::

::: 
::: column

:::info-box
The body responds to stress through 2 major systems:

- The `autonomic` nervous system  
- The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (`HPA`) axis  

These systems operate on `different time scales`.

- `Autonomic responses` 
  Fast, neural, seconds  

- `HPA axis responses`
  Slower, hormonal, minutes to hours  

Both are coordinated but serve different functions.

:::

::: 
::: 

## Autonomic responses in stress

During stress, the autonomic system (the sympathetic division) produces rapid effects:

- Increased heart rate  
- Increased blood pressure  
- Faster breathing  
- Reduced digestion  

These changes prepare the body for immediate action.

## The HPA axis {#hpa}

::: columns
::: column

>The **HPA axis** is a hormonal stress response system.
It `links` the `brain to peripheral` organs through endocrine signaling.
It produces slower but longer-lasting effects than autonomic responses.

During stress:

- The `hypothalamus` is activated ([CRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone))
- The `pituitary` gland releases signaling hormones ([ACTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone))  
- The `adrenal` glands release [glucocorticoids]{.highlight}  

This cascade is a loop.

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_hpa.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}


::: 
::: 

## Cortisol and energy mobilization

::: columns
::: column

Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol:

- Increase `glucose` availability  
- Decrease sensitivity to pain
- Modify immune and metabolic activity  

They `prepare the body` for prolonged challenge.

::: 
::: column

![](images/emot_cortisol.jpg){width="400" fig-align="center"}

::: 
::: 

## Brain control of the HPA axis

::: columns
::: column

:::info-box
Stress responses differ in duration.

- `Acute` stress: Short-term, adaptive, protective  

- `Chronic` stress: Prolonged, costly, potentially damaging  

The difference lies in regulation, not intensity.
:::

::: info-box
The HPA axis is regulated by the brain.
Key contributors include:

- Amygdala  
- Prefrontal cortex  
- Hippocampus  

Stress is not just peripheral.
:::

::: 
::: column
:::tip

Glucocorticoids act back on the brain.
They signal when stress responses should be reduced.
This `negative feedback` limits stress exposure.
:::

:::info-box
If stress responses are not properly terminated:

- Hormone levels remain elevated  
- Brain and body systems are altered  

Chronic stress reflects `dysregulation`, not overreaction.
